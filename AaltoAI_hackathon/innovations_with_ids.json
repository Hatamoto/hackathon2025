        "text": "In the early-to-mid 1900s, physicists were just beginning to understand how to manipulate and control individual quantum objects and materials. These initial efforts led to the birth of information processing technologies that have brought about the digital age. We are now in the second quantum revolution, which is characterised by the creation of devices capable of manipulating and controlling individual quantum states, as well as the algorithms and software that exploit the possibilities arising from these capabilities. These developments are expected to outperform classical computing, communication, and sensing technologies in the near future. These advancements are accomplished through the exploitation of quantum phenomena like the superconductivity of certain materials or the ability of qubits (quantum bits) to be in a superposition of two states. Such phenomena are anticipated to enable enhanced information cryptography, high-precision sensing, new drug development, and high-performance computing, among a host of other outcomes. And the number of operational early-stage quantum computers in the world is growing. Two of them reside in Finland as part of the collaborative partnership of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and IQM. The first, 5-qubit quantum computer was unveiled in 2021, followed by a 20-qubit computer in October 2023. But there is more to the second quantum revolution than computers… While revolutionary supercomputers may be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about quantum technologies, Finland's rich history in the field spans decades and covers many other subject areas. For example, Finland first earned its notoriety in quantum technologies via its low-temperature physics research, pioneered by Olli V. Lounasmaa in the 1960s. Sixty years later, the Finnish cryogenics tech company Bluefors is the world's leading manufacturer of ultra-low temperature refrigerators used in quantum research and technology development. Additionally, Aalto University researchers are at the vanguard of superconductivity research. One consortium, dubbed SuperC 2033 and led by physics professor Päivi Törmä, aims to realise a room-temperature superconductor by the year 2033. Such a discovery is considered by many to be the holy grail of modern-day physics and carries the capacity to revolutionise the ICT sector—an industry reliant on energy-intensive semiconductors. And Finnish researchers aren't afraid to delve into some of the deepest mysteries of quantum physics. Aalto Professor Mika A. Sillanpää leads his research group to prove the existence of quantum gravity, which would effectively demonstrate that gravity has quantum properties and would open doors for a new unified theory. And Aalto Senior Lecturer and Docent Sorin Paraoanu has just received a €2 million grant for his role in the global DarkQuantum consortium, which seeks to prove the existence of dark matter by utilising ultrasensitive quantum detectors. This list just barely scratches the surface of Finnish quantum physicists' accolades, and their efforts are only made possible with a skilled and educated workforce… While this problem is not unique to Finland, its effects can be felt locally. Progress in the field is hindered by the shortage of a skilled and educated workforce. The Finnish Quantum Flagship (FQF) has identified this problem as one of its key focus areas along its eight-year timeline. One of the primary solutions is the recruitment of top international talent. Academicians and industry leaders alike continue to pressure the Finnish government to revise its immigration policies to make the country more attractive to potential workers. Such sentiments were expressed clearly by Aalto University President Ilkka Niemelä in September 2023. While their impact may not yet be fully understood, emerging quantum technologies promise to open doors to an untold number of real-world applications. Accordingly, industries, governments, and research institutions must take a broad approach when considering the training of a future workforce. Beyond quantum physicists, the industry will demand engineers, programmers, product designers, and many more experts of varying areas of specialisation. As global quantum technology powerhouses compete to develop the first computers capable of quantum supremacy, the science that has led to such tantalising possibilities first emerged as subjects of fundamental research. While applied research in fruitful fields is necessary to move the industry's proverbial needle forward, foundations and other funding agencies must remain diligent in their investments in fundamental research. These types of investments in basic research have proven to evolve into applied research with real world applications in the past. The previously mentioned Bluefors case study is just one example of how the labours of previous generations have blossomed into valuable assets for the greater Finni",

        "text": "Aalto University, University of Helsinki and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland have signed an agreement to collaborate on quantum science and technology, under the umbrella of InstituteQ: The Finnish Quantum Institute. InstituteQ brings together expertise in research, education, and innovation to drive Finland's world-leading quantum technology research. 'Our goals are threefold,' explains Professor Jukka Pekola, Aalto University, 'firstly, to coordinate our national research efforts; secondly, to provide the best possible education, both in graduate and industrial programs; and thirdly, in driving innovation.' 'It is widely recognised that the expertise level in the workforce is currently a major bottleneck in developing quantum technology,' explains Professor Sabrina Maniscalco, University of Helsinki, 'By combining and coordinating our resources, we will be able to grow expertise in new directions.' All three of the founder institutions have decades of experience in the research, teaching and commercialisation of quantum science and technology. By joining forces through InstituteQ, the parties aim to keep Finland and Europe at the forefront of an increasingly competitive global !eld. 'We see exponential and sustainable growth opportunities in quantum technologies for the future. We want to be inclusive and invite interested stakeholders - companies and institutions alike - across Finland to join. InstituteQ will be a global window of Finnish quantum expertise and facilitate new, international collaborations' said Dr Himadri Majumdar, VTT, 'Our aim is to all work together to leverage Finland's quantum expertise to create new opportunities - for both research, and business.' 'Quantum technology' is the application of phenomena that arise from the unique behaviour of quantum physics. The most widely recognised technology is quantum computing: making computers that can solve problems that are impossible for regular computers to solve. Quantum computing will be useful for problems like designing new medicines, securing digital communication and data storage, and others. Developing quantum computing requires whole new types of hardware, software, and communication technologies, with completely di\"erent logic from conventional computers. Aalto University, University of Helsinki and VTT are already strong global leaders in the research and development of the technology needed for quantum systems, such as devices and sensors, novel quantum materials, and quantum information. Finland is currently building a 3-stage Quantum Computer in a co- development project led by VTT and together with Finnish start-up IQM. The project showcases Finnish expertise and provides an initial platform for both further research, innovation and commercial activities. 'Finnish companies are already working in this area, both as technology enablers providing the hardware and software to exploit quantum phenomena; and as end-users providing services that use quantum technology to customers' explains Dr Majumdar, 'at InstituteQ we want to work with both.' 'We have a lot of students, both domestic and international who are interested in studying quantum technology' continues Professor Maniscalco. 'By supporting the creation of new professorships and national educational programs across our partner institutions we will be able to grow the expertise here in Finland that industry and academia need to harness the capabilities of quantum technology.' 'In Finland, we already have a strong environment for quantum technology, such as the OtaNano research infrastructure and the QTF Centre of Excellence' says Professor Pekola, 'We want the Institute to guide the development of current infrastructure, and have a role in generating new pathways and projects for quantum technologies. We are looking forward to growing the institute to include more partners, collaborators and stakeholders from across research and industry in Finland. Together we can get the maximum bene!t out of our great research environment, and develop it further to meet the needs of the future.'",

        "text": "Digital revolution in manufacturing technology is largely believed to lie in additive manufacturing – one example being 3D printing of items based on digital models. This enables, for instance, the tailoring of parts and rapid manufacture on demand. While additive manufacturing has been making waves in several industries, it is now finally making a splash in marine sector. Research Team Leader Pasi Puukko from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland says that the utilisation of industrial 3D printing started mainly in three industrial domains: aerospace, automotive and medicine.\"Each of these sectors has somewhat specific drivers and reasons to use this technology. For aerospace, it is lighter structures and fly-to-buy ratio; for automotive, fast prototyping and tooling; for medicine, patient specific instruments, guides, visual models i.e. personalisation,\" says Puukko running down the list.Since the costs of additive manufacturing has come down, 3D utilisation is now about to branch out to new sectors: These include energy, gas & oil, consumer products, and more recently, also marine sector.Puukko notes that marine sector does not get that much benefit from lighter components – and the same stands for the other above-mentioned drivers, as well. \"Thus new types of drivers need to be found in order to make this technology reasonable in the marine sector. Those could be, for instance, better performing components – e.g. components which have optimised liquid or gas flow – or part consolidation where you use one part instead of ten, or digitalised spare parts.\" In April 2018, Technical Research Centre of Finland, VTT succeeded in 3D printing a smart metal shaft using a brand new overall process management chain: 3D printing, sensor technology, wireless data transfer, and condition monitoring all came in the same package. The new manufacturing methods will, hopefully, enable the creation of new business models and provide a competitive edge in developing artificial intelligence. VTT experts believe that the most intense competition in technological development within this sector concerns smart solutions. There is widespread investment in R&D, but few have succeeded in developing a working solution in which sensors form a functional part of a 3D printed metal structure.Puukko is of the opinion that this recent Proof of Concept shows remarkable potential e.g. in condition-based maintenance (CBM): one can make more accurate measurements in situ, and get more reliable data out of phenomenon, since sensors can be located more easily on the right spots.\"It fits very well in applications where conditions are harsh, since sensing elements and wiring are embedded inside the component.\" VTT wants to continue this development with companies who see potential in the additive manufacturing technology for their own business. One such company is certainly Wärtsilä which started experimenting with 3D printing around ten years ago, using plastic 3D printing. However, there was already definite interest towards metal-based 3D printing at the time, and, in 2013-2014, there was a major R&D project exploring the opportunities therein.Juho Raukola, Additive Manufacturing Engineer at Wärtsilä Vaasa, comments that the company is getting started in 3D metal printing. What this means is, in fact, introducing a whole new mentality in manufacturing.\"We must make new parts using brand new design and using brand new methods,\" says Raukola.According to Raukola, instead of merely designing parts, Wärtsilä must now concentrate on the functionalities themselves. \"This way, it all becomes a matter of simply manufacturing those functionalities using the design freedom that additive manufacturing provides.\"Rosario Sommonte, Manager, Strategic Purchasing at Wärtsilä Trieste says the rapid development of 3D metal printing opens new opportunities for Wärtsilä.\"We are now starting our journey with 3D metal printing of spare parts. The first 3D printed materials are in production and we will soon deliver them to the market.\" Raukola's Master's Thesis from Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) – published in 2017 – focused on the characteristics of metal additive manufacturing in four-stroke engine manufacturing process, so he's got a fairly good handle on the recent developments in the field. Raukola is convinced that 3D metal printing is poised to make a big breakthrough in 2020s.\"Already, we can use 3D metal printing to manufacture, for instance, fuel injection components, but the range of things that we can do – or should do – keeps expanding all the time.\"This is an important distinction: since 3D metal printing is more expensive than traditional manufacturing, it makes no sense to try to use 3D printing everywhere.\"It's like a farmer who's using a new Ferrari to plough his field. Sure you can do it, but it's hardly smart.\" About Wärtsilä Wärt",

        "text": "3D-tulostamisen hyötyjä ovat lähes rajattomat suunnittelumahdollisuudet ja se, ettei osien valmistamiseen tarvita erityisiä työkaluja kuten muotteja. Sähkömoottorin prototyyppi osoittaa, että 3D-tulostamisen kaupalliset mahdollisuudet ovat nurkan takana. VTT:n tutkijat ovat jo liki kymmenen vuoden ajan tutkineet 3D-tulostamisen hyödyntämistä sähkökoneiden valmistuksessa. Tutkimustiimin päällikkö Sini Metsä-Kortelaisen mukaan 3D-tulostamisen hyötyjä kannattaa puntaroida monesta näkökulmasta. Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT toi viime syksynä ensiesittelyyn Formnext- ja World PM -messuilla sähkömoottorin prototyypin, jossa on 3D-tulostettuja osia. Moottori herätti laajaa kiinnostusta messujen kansainvälisessä ammattilaisyleisössä. Sähkökoneet ovat nyt kuuma kehityskohde monesta syystä. \"Hiilidioksidipäästöjä halutaan pienentää muun muassa liikenteessä, mikä näkyy sähköautojen määrän kasvuna. Niiden moottoreissa käytetään magneettisia materiaaleja, jotka sisältävät harvinaisia maametalleja. Näistä raaka-aineista on pulaa ja niistä valtaosa tuodaan muun muassa Kiinasta. Tämän vuoksi on tärkeää kehittää uusia vaihtoehtoisia materiaaleja ja materiaalitehokkaita laitteita, jotta voidaan vähentää harvinaisten maametallien käyttöä\", VTT:n Kehittyneet valmistusteknologiat -tutkimustiimin päällikkö Sini Metsä-Kortelainen kertoo. 3D-tulostuksen avulla voidaan tehdä koneiden rakenteista modulaarisia, mikä tekee helpommaksi osien korjaamisen tai kierrättämisen tulevaisuudessa. Magneettisten materiaalien 3D-tulostusta voidaan hyödyntää sähkökoneiden lisäksi myös esimerkiksi kuristimissa ja muuntajissa. Käyttökohteita on runsaasti sähköpyöristä tuulivoimaloihin. 3D-tulostuksesssa osat rakentuvat kerros kerrokselta, kun taas perinteisessä valmistuksessa lähtökohta on materiaalikappale, josta poistetaan materiaalia. Metallien 3D-tulostuksessa yksi yleisimmistä menetelmistä on jauhepetisulatus, jossa metalliosa valmistuu valitusta jauheesta kerros kerrokselta. Laser sulattaa ne kohdat, joihin osa alkaa rakentua. \"Erityistä on se, että 3D-tulostustusprosessissa luodaan jauheesta kappale, jonka materiaaliominaisuudet kuten mikrorakenne poikkeavat perinteisestä. Vaatii tutkimusta, että saadaan ominaisuudet sellaisiksi kuin mitä käyttökohteet edellyttävät\", Metsä-Kortelainen sanoo. 3D-tulostusmenetelmän ehdottomia hyötyjä ovat lähes rajattomat suunnittelumahdollisuudet sekä se, ettei osien valmistamiseen tarvita erityisiä työkaluja kuten muotteja. Onkin mahdollista valmistaa hyvin monimutkaisia, optimoituja ja kevyempiä rakenteita lujuusvaatimuksista tinkimättä. \"Tämä on tärkeää esimerkiksi ilmailussa, jossa kevyempien 3D-tulostettujen osien myötä voidaan säästää polttoainetta merkittävästi elinkaaren aikana.\" VTT:n tutkijat keskittyvät tällä hetkellä vaativiin käyttökohteisiin, kuten konepajojen tarpeisiin, autoiluun, ilmailuun, avaruusteollisuuteen ja ydinturvateollisuuteen. Messuilla julkistetun moottorin lisäksi tutkimustiimit kehittävät muun muassa digitaalisia varaosia, metalliosiin upotettua älykkyyttä, 3D-tulostusprosessin monitorointia ja siihen liittyvää reaaliaikaista laadunvalvontaa. \"Kehitämme VTT:llä jatkuvasti 3D-tulostusmenetelmille uusia materiaaleja sekä niille soveltuvia 3D-tulostukseen ja jälkikäsittelyyn liittyviä prosessointiparametreja.\" Kun materiaali- ja valmistusparametrit on hiottu kuntoon, siirrytään valmistamaan prototyyppejä, joiden avulla tutkimustiimit voivat osoittaa, kuinka hyvin ratkaisut toimivat. Metsä-Kortelaisen mukaan lopputulokset ovat olleet hyviä. \"Olemme saavuttaneet sellaisia ominaisuuksia, joille nähdään kaupallista potentiaalia, vaikka monia vaiheita on vielä edessä ennen ratkaisujen kaupallistamista.\" Kuinka kauan kaupallisia ratkaisuja tai tuotteita täytyy vielä odottaa? \"3D-tulostusta hyödynnetään jo laajasti monissa sovelluksissa. Tulostusmenetelmät toimivat ja soveltuvia materiaaliratkaisuja on kehitetty.\" 3D-tulostettujen sähkökoneiden osien kaupallistamiseen mennee vielä useampi vuosi. Kaupallistaminen edellyttää sekä jauhemateriaalin valmistamisen että 3D-tulostusvaiheen laajentamista teollisen tuotannon mittakaavaan. Lisäksi tarvitaan yrityksiltä riskinottokykyä muun muassa tuotteiden ja valmistusprosessien uudelleensuunnittelussa. 3D-tulostuksen rinnalla voidaan hyödyntää myös muuta teknologiaa, kuten robotiikkaa, autonomisia ratkaisuja sekä tekoälyä. 3D-tulostaminen mullistaa paljon, mutta aivan kaikkea ei voi tai ei kannata tulostaa. 3D-tulostuksen mahdollisia hyötyjä kannattaakin arvioida monesta näkökulmasta, kuten kustannusten, tehokkuuden tai ympäristövaikutusten kannalta. 3D-tulostus ei uhkaa perinteistä valmistusta vaan se avaa uusia mahdollisuuksia täydentää nykyisiä menetelmiä ja tuo joustavuutta. \"",

        "text": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland begins searching for an innovation partner to scale up Finland's next quantum computer, aiming towards 300 qubits. In the innovative co-development project, VTT will also be researching methods for how the developed quantum computer can be optimised for solving mathematical problems typical for new material development. ESPOO, Finland (June 18th, 2024) The Finnish state has committed to finance the procurement of Finland's next quantum computer. The state-owned VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland thus begins a tendering process to look for a partner with whom to begin an innovative co-development project that will scale up the country's most powerful quantum computer towards 300 qubits. With its current innovation partner, VTT has developed 5- and 20-qubit quantum computers. The third and final quantum computer, with 50 qubits, included in current the partnership will be launched later in 2024. The new public call for tenders covers co-development between VTT and the new innovation partner toward computers with higher qubit numbers and increased performance. With the procurement, VTT strives to strengthen Finland's leading position in developing quantum technologies. To gain a competitive advantage for Finland in the quantum computing field, VTT will examine, together with the selected partner, whether it is possible to optimise the quantum computer to solve specific types of mathematical problems. \"VTT has unique expertise in computer-aided materials design, which can be used to accelerate the development cycles of many technologies. This is why we are looking for an innovation partner with whom we can explore optimising the quantum computer particularly for materials modelling. We are convinced that specialisation promotes technological innovations and creates an extensive array of new opportunities for Finnish industry, for example, within the field of chemistry applications and bio-based innovations. This strategy will strengthen our competitiveness and help us differentiate ourselves even more in the global market through our expertise,\" says Antti Vasara, President and CEO of VTT. The procurement is limited to superconducting quantum computers. This technology option best matches VTT's research agendas and supports VTT's already strong and versatile expertise in the development of superconductive quantum technologies. The procurement also aims to create and acquire new immaterial rights related to quantum technologies for Finland. The future partner will be expected to provide a temporary computing service for VTT and its Finnish partners immediately after the launch of the development project. It is predicted that materials research, synthetic biology research, the pharmaceutical industry, and the financial sector will be among the first industries to benefit from quantum computing. Quantum technologies are among the key technologies identified by the European Commission as areas in which Europe wants to spearhead development and reach technological self-sufficiency. The financing granted to VTT for the procurement and development of the quantum computer advances both Finnish and European expertise in quantum technologies and quantum computing. VTT carries out the call for tenders with the help of KPMG. The applications must be submitted by August 2nd. The call for tenders includes several phases, and the goal is to select the supplier in early 2025. For more quantum computing stories from VTT, please visit the newsroom.

Numerous reporters accompany the Air Guitar tourists and competitors from all over the world. This year the international group was offered the possibility to get acquainted with 5G technology and an autonomous vehicle at Nokia's 5G Demo Day. Photo: Air guitarist and Toyota engineer Toshio Kado was impressed by what he saw at Nokia Oulu unit. (Photographer: Marko Pyhähuhta) The 5G Demo Day organised by Nokia on August 23rd continued Nokia's long tradition of demo events where new technology is showcased both for international guests and Nokia's own personnel. Arranged at Nokia's Oulu unit, the event began with an introduction to the possibilities of the 5G network technology as well as Nokia's 5G solutions. In a conference room conveniently located downstairs from Nokia's 5G base station factory, Project Manager Olli Liinamaa of the Oulu 5G Test Network introduced the air guitar guests to the basics and practical benefits of 5G technology. He also explained that Nokia is heavily involved in the technology that will reach actual end consumers in the near future. - Nowadays our slogan is no longer \"Connecting People\" but \"Technology to Connect the World\". For example, we have recently made an agreement worth billions of dollars in the United States with their giant operator T-Mobile,\" Liinamaa says. The speeds that 5G offers are significantly ahead of the current 4G networks. The increase in data rates will make sluggish mobile connections a problem of the past. The new 5G architecture is optimised for connecting machines and devices as well as seamless interaction between these devices and human beings. This opens a field of possibilities ranging from virtual presence to wireless automated factories. After the 5G info, the Demo Day continued with a greatly anticipated number as the participants got the chance to see an autonomous car connected to the 5G network in action. Developed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Martti is the first autonomous car in the world to cope with snowy conditions. The car arrived in Oulu from Tampere together with VTT researchers and Nokia equipped it with the 5G capabilities. At this point, the international visitors were accompanied by dozens of other spectators as many of Nokia's own personnel gathered outside the unit to wonder at the exceptionally independent Volkswagen Touareg despite the pouring rain. Martti then drove several times up and down the strip of road in front of the spectators, dodging the obstacles set up in its path and making a huge impression on the audience. Martti does not mind a little bit of rain, for the autonomous VTT cars (Martti and Marilyn) can see better than the human eye in foggy and even snowy conditions and are also able to drive in bad weather without unnecessary stops. They are equipped with a variety of cameras, antennas, sensors, scanners and radars. - Although the car's range of vision in a thick fog is limited to about 30 metres, a new type of radar makes it possible for the car to keep driving slowly instead of stopping completely, Project Manager Matti Kotila from VTT's robot car team explains. Through the robot car research, VTT is creating new innovations for safe operation of automatic vehicles in all conditions. Martti is the first automated car to have driven fully autonomously on a real snow-covered road, where Martti drove at the speed of 40 km/h which is the limit it has been programmed not to exceed. In transportation in general, 5G technology can be used to create safer roads and to improve the flow of traffic. Sensor data collected from cars is usable for road maintenance purposes or for communication between different vehicles. The Demo Day participants also had the opportunity to peek inside Nokia's 5G field test vans and get acquainted with their functions. A large screen installed inside one of the vans illustrated the data collected by the external sensors in real time. Next the visitors got to experience Nokia's 5G solution and its testing in practice. OTAVA (Over-The-Air Validation Area) is the flagship laboratory of Nokia's 5G testing and it offers the possibility to get acquainted with the different phases of 5G testing, conducted with real 5G devices which are not yet commercially available. The OTA test introduction gave the guests a practical and eye-opening insight to the many aspects of launching a new technology. Within the massive facility, the visitors were introduced to items such as a base station user's guide implemented by virtual reality and drones used in 5G radio signal diagnostics. Among the guests was Japanese air guitarist and Toyota City technical centre engineer Toshio Kado who navigated around the base stations with a virtual jetpack in a virtual world as if he had been doing it all his life. - I loved the demos.

        "text": "One example of the advanced local ecosystems is the decision to be one of the first constructors of 5G test networks and construct two of them in Oulu. A significant number of international corporations relocated to Oulu during the second half of 2014. This surely must be a record in the Finnish industrial history that such a major contribution was made to the field of development in hi-tech in such a short period of time. Eleven of these corporations are in ICT and almost the same number in other fields. Over the past couple of years the ICT ecosystem in Oulu has diversified considerably: While it earlier depended on two drivers, the mobile phone and mobile network knowledge and knowhow, it is complemented by clusters producing finance, health tech and automotive solutions. The companies established in Oulu in fall 2014 employ more than 500 people at the moment and are determined to grow further during the coming year. The City of Oulu warmly welcomes all these actors to participate in the dynamic ecosystems in Oulu and wishes to express their special thanks to individuals and teams who unhesitatingly seized the opportunity to promote the world's most skilful and knowledgeable workforce in their field, former Microsoft and Broadcom employees, along with the local research and development culture which is forward-oriented and capable of successful cooperation. Oulu ecosystem has established itself as the hot bed of wireless technologies.

CISSAN builds methods and technology for integrating collective security intelligence to IoT networks. CISSAN-powered networks will be able to collaboratively identify tampered and adversarial devices, detect malicious activities, and select effective countermeasures. Higher IoT network resilience with be accompanied by resource efficiency through intelligent distribution of security functionalities across network nodes. CISSAN is EU CELTIC-NEXT project (https://www.celticnext.eu/project-cissan/). In Finland CISSAN belongs to Bittium´s Seamless and Secure Connectivity program funded by Business Finland. Main focus The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) has fundamentally changed how different environments, such as homes, offices, factories, smart buildings, and smart grids, are used and operated. However, security is a major concern for IoT networks and environments, where the risks of physical device tempering, injection of malicious devices, and unpatched vulnerabilities are higher than in traditional networks. CISSAN proposes and implements algorithms for mitigating IoT security threats through collective decision-making and with a reduced impact on the limited resources of IoT devices. These algorithms will be based on research and innovation in optimizing the distribution of security capabilities and aggregating the intelligence in IoT network nodes. Three industrial use cases, which nowadays heavily rely on the use of IoT, will inform the project developments and will be used for validating and demonstrating the project results: (i) public transportation; (ii) smart energy grids; (iii) mining and tunneling operations. Approach CISSAN will research and implement algorithms for distributed security monitoring, attack detection and response in IoT networks. Such algorithms will combine machine learning-based methods, more traditional AI techniques (e.g., decision-making based on formal knowledge representation and expert systems, fuzzy logic-based approaches, or genetic algorithms), and attack-specific rules. Since increasing the level of autonomy in IoT network defence is one of the high goals of the project, we will propose mechanisms for collective decision-making by CISSAN \"security agents\", which are essentially security functions placed to IoT network nodes. Blockchain-based consensus protocols are one possible type of such mechanisms to be considered in the project. To enable communication between the security agents, CISSAN will implement a light overlay networking solution. Also, methods and tools will be developed for verifying the quality of data sets",

Suomen vahva asema erityisesti uuden sukupolven kommunikaatioteknologioiden kehittämisessä on omiaan houkuttelemaan Suomeen alan toimijoita ja osaamista. Suomen profiloituminen kaksoiskäyttöön soveltuvien kommunikaatioteknologioiden suurvaltana lisää myös Suomen houkuttelevuutta kansainvälisten rahoittajien silmissä ja vahvistaa Suomen teknologista panosta Naton jäsenenä. Puolustusministeriö on kansallinen vastuuviranomainen kansallisten DIANA-kiihdyttämöiden ja testikeskuksten ehdottamisessa ja hyväksymisessä sekä virallisessa yhteydenpidossa DIANA:n sihteeristöön. Puolustusministeriö edustaa Suomea DIANA:n johtokunnan kokouksissa ja vaikuttaa aloitteen teknologisten painopistealueiden määrittämiseen. DIANA:n johtokunta koostuu yhdestä edustajasta jokaisesta NATO:n jäsenmaasta. Suomalaisyritykset voivat osallistua DIANA–haasteohjelmiin, joiden perusteella valitaan ohjelmaan kutsuttavat yritykset. Haasteohjelmien kautta valitut yritykset saavat ensimmäisessä vaiheessa 100 000 euron rahoituksen tuotekehitykseen ja osa valituista yrityksistä toisessa vaiheessa 300 000 euron rahoituksen. Tämän lisäksi yritykset pääsevät testaamaan teknologisia ratkaisujaan ja todentamaan niiden kaksikäyttöpotentiaalia DIANA-testikeskuksissa ja tämän lisäksi kehittämään liiketoimintamahdollisuuksiaan DIANA-kiihdyttämöissä. DIANA-verkosto toimii yrityksille alustana verkostoitua ja rakentaa uusia kansainvälisiä kumppanuuksia. Parhaassa tapauksessa yritykset löytävät DIANA:n kautta loppukäyttäjän kehittämälleen teknologialle tai pidemmän aikavälin jatkorahoittajan. DIANA on Naton yhteisrahoituksen ulkopuolinen ohjelma. DIANA:n toiminnasta koituvat kulut (henkilöstökulut ja yrityksille myönnettävät rahoitukset) rahoitetaan jäsenmaiden yhteisrahoituksella (BKT-perustainen maksuosuus). DIANA:n kokonaisbudjetti vuodelle 2024 on noin 50 miljoonaa euroa. DIANA ei vastaa kiihdyttämötoiminnan kuluista, vaan se kuuluu kiihdyttämöille.

The goal is to build a national research and testing environment that would last until the 2030s, when 6G technology is expected to be in the commercialization phase,\" says Professor Mikko Valkama, who leads the development of the research environment at Tampere University The majority of the funding will be used to purchase very expensive measurement equipment that would be disproportionately expensive for individual research institutes. \"Investments of this scale in the early stages of 6G research and their joint use will boost the international competitiveness and attractiveness of our top research teams, as similar environments are not known to be found elsewhere,\" emphasizes Professor Ari Pouttu, who leads the project at 6G Flagship at the University of Oulu. The evolving 6G research environment creates an excellent framework especially for radio channel measurements, circuit and antenna technology research, and measurements over the air interface, which focus, for example, on device characterization. The combination of measurement devices forms a unique development platform for new methods aimed at the accuracy of centimeter(s) in positioning objects. With 6G, positioning accuracy, and imaging and sensing capabilities integrated into the same system will revolutionize the use of wireless connectivity in a wide range of applications, such as collaborative robots in needs-based adaptive factories, and digital and societal functions such as remote surgery and autonomous transportation. \"The Academy of Finland's decision to enable experimental research of these capabilities in the 6G framework is significant in order to maintain Finland's leading position in 6G research,\" emphasizes Ari Pouttu. Companies will benefit from the diverse experimental environment and expert service in the early stages of 6G research, gaining visibility into new business opportunities and future markets offered by emerging technologies. \"The research infrastructure enables the research, development and testing of new hardware solutions, algorithms, software and applications,\" confirms Jukka Mäkelä, Principal Scientist at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. Over the next five years, investments and co-development must be further strengthened significantly if Finland is to remain at the forefront of 6G technology development. \"Expensive measurement devices used for R&D&I activities in both RF and network technologies must be planned to be increasingly shared in the future,\" envisions Professor Jussi Ryynänen from Aalto University. An advanced research environment requires public project funding to be productive. To support 6G research, a similar investment, which has been made for the computing environment of CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd over time, would be needed but at a faster pace. \"6G research is here and now. Investment decisions are needed today,\" concludes Matti Latva-aho, Director of the 6G Flagship programme. Read more on Academy of Finland news on 1 December 2020.

        "text": "SYNERGY project progresses – Leveraging big data for the electricity value chain Caverion Corporation Article 20 November 2020 at 10.45 a.m. EET International SYNERGY project progresses – Leveraging big data for the electricity value chain Caverion is taking part in the SYNERGY project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program. The project aims at leveraging big data of the electricity value framework for a smarter electricity value chain. By developing sharing and trading models for energy data, the project enables shifting individual decision-making to a collective intelligence level. The European building and electricity sectors are undergoing major fundamental changes. The roll-out of smart technology, together with the development of platform technologies, are providing opportunities for creating new energy management strategies and business models. There is a recognised need for end-to-end coordination between electricity sector stakeholders. Project SYNERGY comprises a total of 24 partners from nine European countries, with a total budget of 12,7 million euros. The project introduces a novel framework and big data architecture platform for primary and secondary data related to the electricity value chain. Furthermore, it introduces an AI analytics marketplace for added value analytic applications and innovative energy services. By creating a transparent parallel-economy that rewards data producers, the project hopes to increase amounts and granularity of shared data. Caverion's role in project SYNERGY is primarily as a demo partner. Together with VTT (Technical Research Centre of Finland) and Forum Virium Helsinki (City of Helsinki innovation company), Caverion will develop and implement models for evidence-based renovation support and holistic real-time facility energy management. Furthering e.g. optimisation of building asset predictive maintenance. The project lasts approximately 3,5 years. \"The energy value chain is undergoing major disruption and will play a significant part in creating a smart and sustainable future for European citizens. By identifying synergies and strengthening collaboration with other stakeholders in the building and energy value chain, it is possible to create pioneering business models and new stakeholder value. We at Caverion strongly believe in cooperative ecosystems for innovative value creation,\" says Tapio Lajunen , Head of Technology at Caverion Finland.

This blog post joins the collective insights we at Insta have shared about our internal ROS2 R&D project, the Machine Fleet Simulation Platform (MFSP). The whistleblowing channel is an electronic reporting service that is intended for use by our partners, customers, employees, and other actors. Aleksi Salmirinne, selected as the new head of the Industry business area at the diversified technology company Insta, is starting in his position in early August. Insta takes part in three-year SWARM-C3 project (Command, Control and Communications for Multi-X Swarms) funded by European Defence Fund. The project involves five partners from four European countries. Two Finnish partners are Insta and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. In this blog post, our software developer Hugo elaborates how a robust and scalable cloud-based infrastructure can support productivity, increase efficiency, provide great user experience and foster innovation. He also shares an overview into the components and architecture of our AWS-based system. The use of public cloud services has significantly increased, emphasizing the importance of addressing data protection concerns, especially in terms of key management, during cloud migration. External key management services offer opportunities for better control and easier transition between various services, but it's crucial to select a suitable model based on needs and security objectives. ILA Berlin brings the global aerospace industry to Berlin from 5 to 9 June, 2024. Insta as front-runner and reliable partner for customers in the fields of defence, aviation, software development, and cyber security attends the event. Come to meet our experts and discuss about our advanced defence and aviation solutions! Insta and the Finnish Defence Forces have agreed on the three-year acquisition package related to Finland's F-35 fighter program. The acquisition is based on the strategic partnership agreement between the Finnish Defense Forces and Insta. The year 2023 was a year of records for the technology company Insta. Net sales grew by more than 13% and accelerated to a new record of EUR 173.9 million. At the same time, the past year was Insta's thirteenth consecutive year of growth. In the near future, previous trends of accelerated technological development and digitalization, as well as responsibility and mitigating climate change, will come to the forefront. These trends will transition more strongly from research and objectives into practice and implementation Technological development is making the world more complex, and cyber security solutions must at a minimum keep up with the pace in order for society to utilize the new opportunities. In nuclear projects there is simply no room for compromised cyber security. On the other hand, the flow of data between many stakeholders in the complex ecosystem must be made as unobstructed as possible – while also adhering to laws and regulations. Technology company Insta and Fortum have been doing joint research to meet these seemingly conflicting goals. Children and young people's wellbeing continues to make headlines, and the need for more support is growing. In spring 2024, Insta and Kiilto, two longstanding family businesses, repeated their charitable collaboration for the fifth time in a row. As before, the recipient was chosen by staff vote.

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations complement existing major space systems and expand the possibilities for mission and business critical operations. The Airbus Agnet collaboration solution was demonstrated together with LEO satellite services. Airbus was able to demonstrate its ability to provide its customers a secure Agnet solution with LEO satellite services for field operations and communications with command and control. This enables communications and situational awareness around the world in the areas where high-quality mobile broadband services were not previously available, for example in sparsely populated areas and in shipping. The Agnet user experience was comparable to a 4G terrestrial environment. \"Airbus is proud to have operated this demonstration with LEO satellite services which are a valuable addition to the toolbox of solutions for critical communications needs. Airbus customers are migrating from narrowband public safety networks to mobile broadband solutions based on 4G and 5G technologies and terrestrial mobile networks. In many cases mobile operators' existing networks will be used with certain extensions. Other solutions are also needed to build broad coverage and capacity for public safety operations. LEO satellite services are a valuable solution to these needs\" says Tapio Savunen, director of strategic marketing at Airbus. The Finnish consortium of the project is coordinated by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. VTT also participated in the demonstration and was responsible for technical measurements such as the capacity and performance of LEO satellite services. \"Communications services provided by LEO satellite constellations are an interesting research topic. Broadband communications can be expanded to areas and use cases where it has not been economically and technically feasible so far. Quality and security of these future services rely on analysis and validation methods that are developed in the project,\" says Jani Suomalainen, Senior Scientist at VTT. Airbus' customer Erillisverkot participated in the demonstration event. Erillisverkot has an ongoing migration project called Virve 2, which aims at 4G/5G based services for the needs of public safety and other critical users. \"All technologies that can ensure the connectivity of public safety are of interest to Erillisverkot. Our customers must have connectivity anytime, anywhere\", says Antti Kauppinen, CTO of Erillisverkot. * The demonstration event was part of Celtic-Next AINET-ANTILLAS research project involving partners from Finland, France and Germany. Funded by Business Finland, the Finnish government organis ation for innovation funding and trade, AINET-ANTILLAS project is a three-year project and will end in 2024. The primary objective of the AINET-ANTILLAS Celtic-Next research project is to accelerate digital transformation in Europe by intelligent and secure network automation services. The research objectives Airbus has in the project are particularly related to IoT solutions in critical field operations and the utilisation of new satellite services together with deployable networks. In particular, cyber security solutions are topics of particular interest.

The demonstration showcased how low-latency satellite communications of the OneWeb Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation can support professional and government users to extend critical communications coverage and augment capacity in difficult-to-serve geographies. New satellite terminals support mobility, whether it be on a moving vehicle on the road, an aircraft in-flight, or a ship at sea. The demonstration in Finland focused on the performance of the mobile satellite link providing connectivity to local field operations using moving vehicles.Agnet over Satcom offers added resilience and extended coverage and capacity for professional users, allowing them to continue to communicate without interruption, even in the most demanding of situations. In mission-critical operations, fast, reliable, and available connectivity is essential whenever and wherever the operation takes place. Deployable networks are a good choice, especially in rural areas, where coverage and capacity can be limited.\"Finland has the best terrestrial networks in the world. And 99% of the time, these networks are good enough. However, for users such as organisations that maintain the security, sovereignty, and stability of society, \"close enough\" is not sufficient. We view satellite communication, especially Low Earth Orbit (LEO) services, as a valuable way to augment these world-class terrestrial networks, much more so than before. Our customers operate nationwide, and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites just can't deliver that.\" said Antti Kauppinen, CTO Erillisverkot. As public information on the achievable performance of LEO satellite systems is very limited, prior to the customer demonstrations in Oulu, Airbus Public Safety and Security carried out a Quality of Service (QoS) measurement campaign, in close collaboration with the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, coordinator of the Finnish consortium of the AINET-ANTILLAS project.\"The emerging LEO satellite systems have raised interest in many public and industrial sectors. It was therefore essential to have comprehensive information on the capacity of satellite services, particularly for critical services. These demonstrations of low-latency satellite services on a moving vehicle enabled us to complete our Quality of Service (QoS) measurement campaign, the Oulu one being the third in a series which spanned two years. The LEO satellite testing trials enabled us to develop measurement methods and technology assessment capabilities for our service offerings.\" said Heli Kokkoniemi-Tarkkanen, Senior Scientist at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.Combining critical communications and collaboration solutions, satellite services, and 5G and 6G technologies creates new, unprecedented features for professional users. \"The research objectives Airbus Public Safety and Security has for the project are particularly related to IoT in advanced critical communication solutions during demanding field operations and the use of the latest low-latency satellite services with deployable networks. In particular, the cyber security of these systems is a topic of interest due to the stringent requirements of a demanding customer base.\" said Clemens von Skwarczinsky, Head of Portfolio and Business Support for Airbus Public Safety and Security.The demonstrations were part of the Celtic-Next AINET-ANTILLAS research project involving over 30 partners from Finland, France and Germany.

Ship owners who develop a holistic decarbonisation strategy for the whole fleet and pick the right technology can reach their operational decarbonisation targets. This, in turn, will help them with financial backing and with outpacing the competition. The shipping industry also needs to optimise the complete logistics chain and thus build the framework for decarbonisation. Collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a wide variety of partnerships are needed. The following are just a few examples of Wärtsilä's partnerships and R&D collaboration projects. Wärtsilä is one of the core partners in the ZEEDS initiative, which envisions making zero emissions fuels available to the shipping industry. The work in the ZEEDS initiative is organized into four themes: The Apollo project aims to revolutionize shipping by demonstrating the use of a dual-fuel ammonia engine in a platform supply vessel. This innovative approach is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 70% or more. The project is funded by the EU and focuses on fast-tracking the adoption of ammonia as a sustainable fuel in the maritime industry.The project objectives include for example: The Apollo project benefits from the large experience of the consortium, including Wärtsilä, ship owners and operators, end-users, ship designers and safety experts.The project results will be deployed in the Eidesvik vessel Viking Energy, and its operation will be demonstrated in live operations for Equinor in the North Sea. This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon programme under grant agreement No. 101096299. SeaTech is an EU-funded project where Wärtsilä Finland leads the development of an advanced dual fuel engine.The project objective is to develop two symbiotic ship engine and propulsion innovations which will deliver 30% better fuel efficiency and radical emission reductions. This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 857840. ZES - Zero Emission Services offers a new energy system to make inland shipping more sustainable: a complete product and services package for emission-free sailing based on exchangeable battery containers with green electricity, charging stations, technical support, and an innovative payment concept for barge owners. Wärtsilä is one of the ZES shareholders.The goal of ZES is to make more sustainable inland shipping possible with a new, clean and affordable transport system. Wärtsilä is Mission Ambassador at the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping. In this role, we open for collaboration between not only maritime stakeholders, but also fuel providers, universities, and governments. Wärtsilä worked as a project partner in the NoGAPS project with the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping. The project goal was to develop a Nordic-based concept for an ammonia-powered gas carrier vessel. The ship would both transport ammonia as cargo and utilise ammonia as a zero-emissions fuel. The work continues in the follow-up NoGAPS 2 project whose objective is to develop the ship design for this vessel. The Demo2000 project was launched in 2020 with the goal to demonstrate ammonia combustion in a full-scale environment. Full-scale environment included What have the results been? Learn more on the Demo2000 project – success in collaboration page. Wärtsilä and Carnival Corporation carried out a joint pilot project to reduce plastic materials being used in marine operations. The project was carried out on two Carnival Cruise Line vessels, the Carnival Splendor and the Carnival Freedom. It involved the use of smarter packaging material for spare parts, primarily using recycled paper packaging materials instead of plastic. As a result of this pilot, Wärtsilä Global Logistics Services will be changing its spare part packaging and achieve a reduction of approximately 40 percent in the amount of plastic used. Green Ray is a project for minimising methane slip from LNG vessels and reducing the environmental impact of maritime transport. Its objective is to develop three technologies to install on LNG engines of both existing and new ships.Coordinated by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, the Green Ray project brings together several companies from across the shipping value chain: shipyard Chantiers de l'Atlantique, ship owner CMA CGA, classification society DNV GL, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, ship manager MSC Cruises Management, non-profit organisation Revolve Water, energy major Shell, and Wärtsilä.

        "text": "смени язык сайта на русский. The precast process can be noisy and dusty. It includes heavy-duty machines such as extruders and saws and factory equipment that constantly moves back and forth. Work phases like lifting or climbing to heights can be repetitive and heavy. Product development, in close cooperation with the industry, solves these challenges – and makes precasting safer in all aspects. Knowing the capacity figures or the price tag of a production line is not enough when making an investment decision. According to Jouni Sirkka, Director of Product Development at Elematic, safety at the precast factory is what really counts. \"Creating a safe production line means that, in every single delivery, we make a risk analysis and evaluation that covers the whole supply chain and the entire life cycle of the line – from logistics and startup to operation and maintenance.\" The team that analyses the risks of the supply chain is always formed from people with different viewpoints on safety. Some work closer to product development, others may have views on the safety of the logistics, for example. \"The risk analysis is the basis for all manuals, instructions on safety gear, safety training, and operation and maintenance training,\" Sirkka says. Equipment automation is increasing all the time. \"We develop the safety logics in our machinery constantly to ensure safe operation. Critical functions are duplicated to minimize any failures.\" Reliable and safe technology and automation lead to less downtime when the risks and the way of operating in exceptional production situations have been anticipated well beforehand. \"We aim to reduce human error in all of our equipment. It is considered from the external shield of the equipment to the very core of the machine, and the ways of operating and maintaining it.\" The latest innovations in the field include the loop installation machine for safer lifting of slabs, the inverter in our saw, and the battery mold opening-and-closing device. \"Risk evaluation covers the whole supply chain and the entire life cycle of the line.\" Increased automation minimizes the physically heavy, repetitive, and high-risk work phases, and makes production more flexible and efficient. \"However, automated machinery and equipment also create new types of risks that need to be taken into consideration when planning maintenance or handling unexpected situations in production\", says Risto Tiusanen, Senior Scientist at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. In the EU, for example, safety requirements have been dictated by the Machinery Directive and related standards since 1995. \"All leading component manufacturers and system suppliers today consider safety issues to be business critical.\" The safety of machines, including safety guards or beams, sensors, and other protection systems, is generally on an advanced level. \"This is not enough since the growing trend towards unmanned production in all branches calls for software-based solutions to operate the entire manufacturing system safely and efficiently. We have moved from the safety of machines to a level of system safety\", Tiusanen concludes. Perception: The system identifies the location of operators or maintenance personnel and optimizes production flexibly without downtime. Communication: The increasingly complex systems demand reliable and secure channels to deliver critical data and signals. Openness: Taking safety issues into account at the initial concept design phase or when planning a retrofit – system safety and reliability are created in cooperation with the end user, maintenance, and the equipment supplier. Risto Tiusanen HIGH PERFORMANCE SAWS cut versatile pre-stressed products safely. Elematic's fully automated E9-500 saw is designed for cutting elements vertically up to 520 mm in any direction. A new inverter drive makes the saw easier and safer to operate: the blade can now be stopped automatically and quickly after cutting. Changing the blade is also easier. E9-500 includes an efficient dust removal system consisting of vacuum and an automatically adjusting blade cover to minimize emissions and reduce noise. Casting cells with cast elements weigh several tons, and operating the opening and closing of the mold is a heavy work phase for the operator. This innovation has its roots in discussions with our customers. The easy-to-use, ergonomic mechanism opens and closes the mold at the press of a button. This improves work safety and ergonomics, minimizing the risk of injury. The battery mold device includes a semiautomatic, fixed chain mechanism at the bottom of the mold. A control cabin with push buttons is the default way to operate the device, and a radio-control option is available for challenging working spaces. People who have worked on the battery mold previously have experienced ache and stress on the hands and upper arms due to the heavy opening and closing",

This four-year program covers Valmet's entire offering and aims to transform waste and emissions into valuable resources for sustainable growth and accelerate the green transition. The program is co-funded by Business Finland. Photo: More than 180 ecosystem partners gathered in Tampere in September to discuss and network at the Beyond Circularity ecosystem event. The program has been ongoing for 2.5 years and it has made substantial progress. A critical component of the Beyond Circularity program is its ecosystem. In the innovation field, one plus one is always more than two. By combining diverse skills, experiences, and approaches, we can create added value beyond a single company or organization could achieve. Given the complex challenges humankind is facing, innovation, collaboration, and leadership from different stakeholders are a must, says Virpi Puhakka, who leads Valmet's Beyond Circularity ecosystem. The Beyond Circularity ecosystem has grown remarkably fast. Originally targeting 100 partners by the end of 2025, it has already attracted over 250 partners working on 30 ecosystem projects. The ecosystem project portfolio is very wide, including projects from all streams and from all our businesses. Ecosystem projects are in different stages, some are on the final phase, when some are only starting. Internally, nearly 100 program-related R&D projects are underway, with active participation from most of Valmet's R&D professionals. The co-innovation project 'High Performance Cellulose-based Composites' (HiPer) is the first ecosystem project to be completed. Valmet collaborated with nine other Finnish companies and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland to study the usage of biocomposites on an industrial scale. Biocomposites play a crucial role in transitioning to lighter materials, reducing the use of fossil-based raw materials, and improving recycling efficiency to lower industrial emissions. During the project, HiPer team successfully demonstrated the manufacturing of thermoplastic composites on a pilot paper machine. Read more about the results on valmet.com.

Our objective is for 100% of our products to be designed to be recyclable, compostable, or re-usable. Our 2030 sustainability program includes carbon-neutral production and science-based emission targets. We embed sustainability in everything we do. For us, sustainability means considering the impact we have – both positive and negative – throughout the value chain, in terms of the environment, social responsibility and governance. We believe that the value of packaging is more than its impact on the planet and that we can make a difference in the food system value chain in several ways. We aim to minimize the negative impacts of our operations and products on the environment while maximizing the positive impacts on our stakeholders, consumers and society. Our sustainability ambition at a glance We see sustainability as a key differentiator. Our work in the Packaging for Good program, launched in 2018, has been the founding block for our 2030 sustainability ambition. Going forward, delivering on our 2030 sustainability ambition will set the pace and framework for how we embed sustainability across our organization. Our sustainability ambitions are in line with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact initiative, which covers the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set out a holistic approach and areas of focus. We recognize their value ensuring a sustainable, resilient and inclusive future in which no one is left behind. In 2020 we reviewed our contribution to the SDGs and identified the areas within the 17 SDGs most relevant to what we do. This resulted in the alignment with three main goals and two supporting goals as a basis for our 2030 sustainability ambition. Defining where we have most impact in the Sustainable Development Goals: Our three main Sustainable Development Goals SDG 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all We continue to make safety and how we engage with our people to reach their full potential a top priority. We believe that providing a healthy and safe working environment, respecting human rights and maintaining a fair, diverse and inclusive workplace are instrumental in advancing sustainability throughout our value chain. SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns We support the sustainable use of natural resources by: SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts We are committed to set science-based carbon emission targets by 2022 and actively encourage our suppliers, distributors and customers to also sign-up and set their targets accordingly. We believe that packaging that protects the product, reduces waste and enables efficient recycling will make a great contribution towards a sustainable future. It also will help to transition to a climate neutral society. Our ambition is to achieve carbon neutral production by 2030. As part of our due diligence processes, we also identify and evaluate climate change risks to the business and take appropriate mitigating and adaptive action. Our two supporting Sustainable Development Goals SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all We focus on managing and mitigating our impacts on water resources in our water management plans. We safeguard water ecosystems especially in the water stress areas. SDG 15: Protect sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and sustainably manage forests We use certified fiber to promote biodiversity and best practices in sustainable forest management.

        "text": "Following this month's gathering of world leaders to address global warming at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP26) summit in Glasgow, green energy has become the topic on everyone's lips. One form of green energy, hydrogen, has the potential to transform the way we power our lives and is essential to tackling climate change in the future. Now, innovative Finnish businesses, research centers and government figures have come together to utilize their hydrogen expertise and rigorous skills to spearhead a green revolution that will make Finland a world-leading hydrogen economy. Finland is a small country with big ambitions to become carbon neutral by 2035 and carbon negative by 2050 – some of the most ambitious targets globally. The country is committed to leveraging collaboration and global partnerships to develop hydrogen technologies, innovations and research to help maintain and secure a viable planet for future generations. Hydrogen is a versatile fuel that can be used to provide a clean alternative to oil and gas in sectors such as domestic and business heating, heavy industry, agriculture, road transport, maritime and aviation. It is also an important energy carrier, enabling long-term storage from renewables and transportation over long distances from regions with abundant solar and wind resources. That is why it is currently gaining renewed and rapidly growing attention in Europe and worldwide. Ground-breaking Finnish initiatives to use hydrogen to help tackle climate change include BotH₂nia, an umbrella brand and collaboration platform for building a large-scale hydrogen economy around the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea. The Gulf of Bothnia has been identified as a promising region for increased hydrogen production, transport, storage and usage. The Finnish businesses involved aim to capitalise on economic opportunities and investment, enabling the country to commence world-leading hydrogen projects and cross-industrial systemic solutions over the next few years. One such business is the Finnish smart technology group, Wärtsilä, which develops solutions for the marine and energy markets. In July 2021, the company launched a major test programme towards carbon-free solutions with hydrogen and ammonia fuels, helping enable the energy and marine sectors to shape sustainable and efficient future fuels in several cost-optimal steps. Wärtsilä is also partnering with Vantaan Energia and Neste – a leader in sustainable aviation fuel – and VTT to seek a breakthrough in Finnish e-fuel technology. The project is linked with the Veturi ecosystem, which creates solutions to reduce the use of crude oil. Today, hydrogen represents only a modest fraction of the global and EU energy mix. It is still produced mainly from fossil fuels, notably from natural gas or coal, resulting in 70 to 100 million tonnes of CO2 annually in the EU. For hydrogen to contribute significantly to climate neutrality, it needs to be produced a far larger scale, and its production must become fully decarbonised. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, one of Europe's most prominent research institutions, is leading the way in this endeavour. VTT's research has led to the development of a high-temperature electrolysis system that meets the challenges of zero-emission hydrogen production, making the process of producing environmentally friendly hydrogen more efficient. Larger power plants can now be built, based on this modular, solid oxide technology achieving higher efficiency compared to competing electrolyzer technologies. Dynamic Finnish start-up Hycamite is also developing technology to produce clean hydrogen and pure carbon by decomposing methane from natural gas or biogas. This ground-breaking solution releases no emissions into the atmosphere and provides the components in a usable form for industries worldwide. One small company with big ambitions is P2X Solutions, which plans to build Finland's first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant. When completed, the plant will produce green hydrogen with electricity produced from renewable energy. The home-grown clean energy source has the potential to transform the way we power our lives and will be essential to tackling climate change. That is why Finland is bringing a pipeline of dynamic hydrogen projects to life to make this a reality. Helena Sarén, Head of Smart Energy at Business Finland, says: \"Finland is committed to bringing innovation, technology and businesses together to create business opportunities and achieve our goal of maintaining and securing a viable planet for future generations. We aim to do that by decreasing our carbon footprint here in Finland, while simultaneously increasing the carbon handprint globally through Finnish businesses and their solutions. This way, we can have a greater impact on the global climate change battle compared to our true size. \"Seizing the opportunities of hydrogen is a glo",

According to VTT's scenario calculations, if used to manufacture high added-value products, Finnish forest and field biomass could double in value by 2050. It is possible to do all this and, at the same time, reach the climate targets set for the country. This scenario work is the first analysis of Finland's potential in the bioeconomy and its transition to a low-carbon economy, which takes account of all industrial and emission sectors. The objective of Finland's national bioeconomy strategy is to create 100,000 new jobs in the country and increase the bioeconomy output by EUR 40 billion by 2025. The research and development work to be performed under CERES will support the delivery of this objective and help companies to make new openings in the international market. On 23 August 2018, VTT President and CEO Antti Vasara and Aalto University President Ilkka Niemelä signed a collaboration agreement to establish the CERES ecosystem. In this agreement, both parties emphasise their willingness to create a joint ecosystem in the field of biomaterial research, as well as create ground rules for successful cooperation. The agreement also aims to support the commercial exploitation of project results. CERES will function as a virtual knowledge centre. It will develop new methods for biomass processing as well as material solutions based on these, and provide the industry long-term, globally cutting-edge R&D work.

        "text": "Neste Corporation, Press Release, 22 June 2022 at 12 noon (EET) Power-to-Liquids technologies are on their way to commercialization in scale. E-fuels offer a way to expand the carbon-neutral transport fuel pool beyond biomass-based renewable fuels to replace fossil fuels in existing internal combustion engines. The end product is a transportation fuel suited for aircraft, ships as well as heavy and light road vehicles. Development of high temperature electrolysis, CO2 capture, and hydrocarbon synthesis technologies have been completed in Business Finland funded Veturi E-fuel research project and the integrated technology is now ready for implementation. VTT and Neste have agreed to build a technology demonstration facility at VTT Bioruukki Pilot Centre, Espoo. The work has started by first modifications to the research infrastructure at VTT Bioruukki. During 2022 and early 2023, electrolysis, CO2 capture, and synthesis units located in sea containers will be connected to each other and VTT Bioruukki research infrastructure. The E-fuel project pilot runs are expected to be completed during 2023. Establishing the infrastructure for Power-to-Liquids production contributes to the strengthening of co-operation between Neste and VTT in e-fuel production development from pilot to commercial scale. \"Neste as the world's leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel refined from waste and residues sees Power-to-Liquids as a possible complementing technology for future sustainable fuel production. We need breakthrough innovations and continued focus on research and technology development in order to provide cost-efficient and value-creating solutions for the future,\" says Lars Peter Lindfors, Senior Vice President Innovation at Neste. The technology demonstration will employ CO2 capture from flue gas, hydrogen production by highly efficient high-temperature electrolysis and fuel synthesis based on the Fischer-Tropsch technology. Both the CO2 capture and electrolysis solutions are provided by Finnish project partners, Kleener Power Solutions Oy and Carbonreuse Finland Oy as well as Convion Oy and Elcogen Oy, respectively. VTT will provide the fuel synthesis unit and technology and Neste carries out upgrading of the synthetic crude oil into fuel products fulfilling the specifications. Neste is expecting to see a successful integrated demonstration of technologies and to receive at least 300 kg of synthetic crude oil for synthetic fuel processing development. Neste is actively building technology solutions and business to realize commercial production of sustainable e-fuels. Neste started this business platform in its Innovation unit in 2019 as part of its efforts aiming towards commercialization of Power-to-X strategy for synthetic e-fuel and e-feedstock production. Such pilot projects support competence development at Neste as well as more broadly and offer a venue for focused process development and R&D in key technology areas relevant to Power-to-X commercialization. \"Substitution of crude oil in transportation requires utilization of all sustainable solutions like renewable fuels, electric vehicles and synthetic fuels (e-Fuels via Power-to-X). Power-to-X is one technology pathway, which has the potential to unlock new raw material pools beyond biomass with innovation to accelerate emission reduction in transportation,\" says Dietmar Huber, Vice President Innovation Business Platform Power-to-X at Neste.

        "text": "In April, the Council of Europe and the European Parliament reached a political agreement on the Union's Chips Act. The aim is to increase the EU's global market share in semiconductor production to at least 20% by 2030. This will reduce the EU's vulnerability and dependence on foreign actors and improve the security of supply, resilience, and self-sufficiency of the chips sector. The Chips Act will mobilise some €43 billion of public and private investments to support, for example, technological capacity building and related research and innovation in European Union member states. The City of Tampere and Tampere University actively promote the objectives of the Chips Act at the regional and national levels. Together with Aalto University, City of Espoo, Technology Industries of Finland's semiconductor industry group, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and partner companies they have proposed a national chips programme for Finland. - We hope that the new Government Programme will commit to arranging national funding for the Chips from Finland initiative, says Teppo Rantanen, Executive Director of Economic Policy, Competitiveness and Innovation at City of Tampere. The creators of the Chips from Finland initiative are seeking a slice of the hundreds of millions of euros in the funding sources of the Chips Act. The funding would be used, among other things, to build chips competence centres and pilot environments in Tampere and Espoo. - As soon as possible, we will apply for funding mostly for equipment that will enable the assembly, packaging, testing and verification of the functionality of complex microelectronic and photonic components and circuits. The System in Package chip piloting environment SIPFAB, which is planned for Hervanta in Tampere, could house such devices. The piloting environment would enable the design, development and testing of III-V elements-based semiconductor chips in cooperation with businesses, says Pauli Kuosmanen, Director of Research and Innovation Services at Tampere University. Tampere has already demonstrated strong expertise in key areas of chips expertise, such as photonics and system circuit design. Tampere University is leading PREIN, a national photonics flagship platform funded by the Academy of Finland. It is also coordinating the SoC (System-On-Chip) ecosystem project, which focuses on system circuit design. The project is developing expertise in system circuit design and microelectronics in Finland and Europe together with a consortium consisting of Nokia and other companies. In the SoC Hub project, Cargotec, for example, participates in investigating how its own systems on a chip could give a competitive edge to the company. Nokia and Tampere University are also jointly developing 5G-Advanced and future 6G network technology. - In the future, Tampere can offer expertise and development capacity to industry and businesses. By designing and piloting their own chips, the branch can gain a competitive advantage, which also means that Tampere will attract new investments, says Kuosmanen. The strengths and prospects of Tampere's chips expertise and 6G research will be presented to representatives of the European Parliament Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on 17 May 2023. Henna Virkkunen, Miapetra Kumpula-Natri and Mauri Pekkarinen, among others, will visit Tampere University and companies in the Tampere region.

        "text": "The 'Chips from Finland' (Siruja Suomesta) initiative aims to build a European ecosystem of semiconductor and quantum industry in Finland based on the special expertise of companies and researchers in the field. This will bring fresh expertise and growth to Finland and strengthen microchip self-sufficiency and technological sovereignty in Europe. – Finland needs a comprehensive microchip strategy to make the most of European investments. We have an excellent opportunity to form a European ecosystem of microchip expertise, as Finland is one of EU's top experts in designing system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions for mobile communication networks and a pioneer in special processes in microelectronics. We also have top-notch expertise in quantum technology and integrated photonics. By concentrating on these strengths, we can create powerful growth within high technology expertise, innovation, and industry in Finland, says Mayor of Tampere Anna-Kaisa Ikonen. Finnish microchip expertise is already used in Europe's most advanced SoCs. – In the past few years, we have strengthened our technological leadership in 5G mobile networks with the help of ReefShark SoCs designed in Finland. Very strong growth is on the horizon in the number of 5G network users and the volume of transferred data globally. We have also already begun developing the next generation of 6G and AI circuits in Finland. Joining forces to develop this field in Finland is highly important. The 'Chips from Finland' initiative will attract investors to Finland to develop microchip technology while offering students plenty of good opportunities to advance in the field. A centre of expertise spanning Espoo, Tampere and Oulu and geared towards developing European 6G and Edge technologies is needed to support the strong cooperation between academic researchers and businesses, says Nokia Vice President Veijo Kontas. The teeny-tiny microchips are important in all aspects of everyday life and in all fields. They are used in mobile phones, mobile communication networks and cars, for example, as well as in high tech safety and security devices. Microchips are a burning issue and a booming business measured in the hundreds of billions. USA and China are fighting for dominance over microchips, and spurred on by the shortage of chips the European Union has created its own Chips Act to ensure the union's digital sovereignty. Its objective is to strengthen chip design, production and packaging in Europe. As a result, centres of expertise in chip technology and pilot environments are to be established in EU member states and investments are to be accelerated with 43 billion euros. – Ensuring Finland's strong position in implementing the Chips Act and securing EU funding will require efficient cooperation on a national level and collaboration between research and business, as well as national commitment and a financial appropriation. The benefits to be gained are significant, as the semiconductor industry is business worth 600 billion euros worldwide. It could grow into an industry worth several billions in Finland, too, and employ thousands of highly paid top experts, says Mayor of Espoo Jukka Mäkelä. 'Chips from Finland' Proposals for Action 1. Strengthen chip expertise and co-creation by forming a national networked c chip competence center. The core will be formed by Tampere University's SoC Hub and Aalto University's circuit design unit with Nokia already closely involved with both. The centre will support companies using chips now and in the future in developing their expertise, and it will assist ecosystem projects where chip technologies (such as RISC-V) are utilised in digitalising industry and other fields towards carbon neutral processes. Why? Design is both the most economically profitable and the most knowledge intensive part of chips value chain. It enables development of chips that provide a competitive edge for products in different fields, which increases demand for the chips. The shortage of top expertise in chip design is one of EU's strategic weaknesses, while Finnish universities and companies alike have been developing microchips for mobile phones and data communication networks since the beginning of the nineties. 2. Provide growth opportunities for companies in the semiconductor industry by investing in mutually complementary pilot environments. 'Kvanttinova', a co-creation-based environment for piloting microelectronics and quantum technology, would augment the existing cleanroom infrastructure for microelectronics research, 'Micronova', located in Otaniemi, Espoo. It focuses on special processes in microelectronics and quantum technologies, in which Finland is a strong pioneer both in Europe and globally.

        "text": "The first tram built for the Tampere tramway was delivered from the Škoda Transtech plant in Kajaani to Tampere in May 2020. According to the plans, a total of 19 trams will operate in the Tampere tramway network in 2021 after the final type approval. In addition to designing and building the trams, Škoda Transtech is in charge of maintenance operations, whereas VR is responsible for driver services and Tampere Tramway Ltd. for the construction of the tramway infrastructure and the procurement of rolling stock. Cinia built a reliable and cost-effective telecommunications solution for the trams. The Tampere tramway is an ambitious project, and the high quality requirements are evident every step of the way. - From the beginning, we have wanted to enable the realtime collection and utilisation of various types of information, meaning that vast quantities of data is constantly moving into and out of the tram, says SmartRail Project Manager Kai Hermonen from Škoda Transtech Ltd. A functional, integrated telecommunications link built between the tram and the rest of the infrastructure, securely transmitting information for various operators, is a key factor. - All the operations, from maintenance to infrastructure management, have to be based on information, says Hermonen. Even though the first tram has arrived in Tampere, there is a lot of work still to be done before the operating environment is finished. Communication between devices and tram networking have been designed to meet modern requirements, but it is also important to offer a functional basis for building future solutions. With the right choices and wellexecuted solutions, the sky is pretty much the limit. Among other things, data enables the development of an intelligent passenger count system. The driver can use the management system to monitor the number of people, bicycles or prams on board. This information can also be delivered to the passengers waiting at the stop. The solution produced by Cinia focuses on a system developed for the needs of the rolling stock, independently performing various necessary tram functions. The solution offers all data a single, secure channel in and out. Cinia's comprehensive solution makes it easier to integrate systems from different suppliers. In addition, potential future changes will not require dismantling the entire system. - The lifecycle of a tram is about 30–40 years, which means that the devices must stay up to date through upgrades or be replaceable with technology that meets changing needs. Cinia's solution enables the integration and replacement of various devices without overlapping issues. In practice, all the data travels through a single channel, says Hermonen. Right in the middle of the critically important implementation stage, the COVID-19 pandemic turned the world upside down. Usually, the plant and depot are teeming with people in the implementation stage as suppliers are making adjustments and carrying out customisation work. The restrictions due to COVID-19 meant that no one could travel to Kajaani, and there had to be another way to finish the installations. - Cinia's remote solution helped us set up the implementation environment very quickly. The softwaredefined networking (SD-WAN) solution and Cinia's backbone network helped open secure connections for operators to the exact devices they needed to access. In fact, it made implementation so effortless that we will probably use remote connections in our future adjustments and updates as well, says Hermonen. Transtech is a cooperating partner in a long-term research project of the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, which aims to produce the best integrated tram functions and services in the world. VTT acts as an innovation partner of Škoda Transtech and as a research project coordinator in the ecosystem. Tampere Tramway Ltd. and Helsinki City Transport enable various pilot projects in Tampere and in the metropolitan area to speed up the implementation of solutions meeting user needs. - The goal of the urban environments to establish a sustainable, useroriented traffic system. Our technological focus is to implement the best tram in the world in terms of passenger and lifecycle services, says Hermonen. Compiling and using the data collected by the tram play a crucial role. The tram is equipped with various sensors that constantly produce information on passenger volumes as well as any anomalies and maintenance needs in the tramway network. In addition, new opportunities are built around the existing training simulator to create various scenarios from the real world as part of driver training. What makes the project particularly interesting is that the urban environment of Tampere has been offered as a testing field for these future solutions. The tram is more than a lump of metal on tracks, it is a mobile data collection system. - Tampere will be a pioneer of intelligent urban transpor",

        "text": "In January 2023, a training programme on design capabilities in line with the circular economy will start for businesses in Finland. The programme will be unique even by international standards. The Circular Design – a path towards circular economy programme is the first of its kind that focuses on the circular economy principles for design and practical solutions for business. Companies of different sizes are participating: Stora Enso, UPM, Mirka, Helkama Velox, Kiilto and Genelec. \"Some truly pioneering companies are participating. This is the start of a new way of thinking about business and products, and hopefully the programme will help generate new ideas and practices in key sectors. The programme is part of the implementation of Finland's national circular economy strategic programme,\" says Taina Nikula, an advisor at the Ministry of the Environment. The construction sector was eager to join – after all, the sector is part of the Green Deal agreement, and the trade association has been active in promoting the circular economy. Textile industry businesses were also keen to apply. A total of 71 businesses applied for the programme, of which 50 were chosen. According to Saija Malila and Anne Raudaskoski, who run the joint project of Design Forum Finland and Ethica, the main criteria was to find participants with a genuine motivation, the necessary resources for development work, and an interest in an explorative training programme that combines the circular economy and design thinking. \"We didn't want to exclude any sector or business on the basis of, for example, their size or turnover.\" Kiilto will be represented by all B2B business areas, construction, industrial adhesives and fireproofing and professional hygiene. \"From the viewpoint of product and service development, I consider value chain thinking extremely important. You also need the capability to design products in a way that they comply with the circular economy models. We know our products and customers, which is mental capital we can draw on to create new and sustainable business. I'm sure the programme will give us new insights into this work,\" says Kiilto's Research, Development and Innovation Director Oili Kallatsa. \"Once we learn more about the added value of the circular economy on different sectors, it is also important to communicate about it efficiently. This is how good operating practices can be utilised optimally,\" she adds. Source:https://circulardesignsuomi.fi/ One of the goals of the circular economy is to find solutions that improve the environment, instead of minimising the negative effects. Design carried out under the principles of the circular economy means that products and services are not developed for just one end user in mind. As an alternative, new solutions are designed to operate in larger contexts and to produce more value through multiple life cycles and users. For companies, this translates to new business opportunities and maybe even a change in the entire operating environment. Tomi Takala, Business Area Director of Industrial Adhesives and Fireproofing at Kiilto, is excited about the training programme, and sees the advancement of the circular economy as a key part in the achievement of environmental goals. \"We have set ambitious goals to minimise our environmental impacts and to be the forerunner in our sector in terms of sustainability. This calls for a circular economy frame of mind and cooperation throughout the value chain, and we are very excited about joining this training programme to get new ideas and tools to reach our goals,\" he says. \"It's important to have a varied group of companies round the table, because no single party can implement circular economy on their own. The effects can be felt not only by the participating businesses but primarily by our customers and society at large. The circular economy can help us find entirely new ways of doing things more sustainably,\" says Takala. Banner Image: Circular Economy Kick Off Event, Tiedekulma. Photographer, Petri Antila.

We unite the experts in mining and make mining an interesting study option for students. The cement industry produces 8 % of the world's carbon emissions, and the supply of sand is running out. We research how sand can be replaced and how millions of tons of industrial waste can be turned into raw materials.Xplorer is an expert in separation technology, waste treatment and circular economy. Tailings are produced when you extract a target mineral from ore, and then store the un-used ore and rock in large dams. There are, however, safer technologies to store the waste. At the moment over 71 % of excavated material ends up in a dump. In Finland the amount of mining waste is 76 % of the total amount of waste produced in the country. Water is critical in mining and in enrichment processes. Particularly in rainy regions, it is important to control the water balance to avoid breaking or overflowing dams. Different water treatment technologies offer new tools for this, tools which assure discharge is as clean as possible. Direct carbon emissions are fairly low in mining. However, within the industry efforts are underway to lower them even more via electrification of machinery. Mining supports effects vis-à-vis climate by producing metals for batteries, the key product for electrification. There are over 60 different metals in a smart phone. How and where have they been excavated? By studying mining engineering, you can impact how raw materials are being produced. The universities in the Xplorer network offer higher degree education and joint degree programs, and professional continuing education. Together we organize seminars and conferences in the mining sector. Xplorer has involved in organizing several webinars and seminars, one of which was series of seminars on tailings and how it could be used as a raw material. The seminar had four parts, and it was organized by LUT/Xplorer, University of Oulu, GTK (Geological Survey of Finland) and VTT (Technical Research Centre of Finland). The seminar series on side streams has led to the Co-Creation project Circular Economy Integrated Mining funded by Business Finland, where the Co-Innovation project is currently being prepared. Xplorer was the main organizer of the NOFS19 symposium (19th Nordic Filtration Symposium) in 2023, where mining was featured prominently. The first Xplorer conference will be held in Lappeenranta on June 11-12, 2024. Starting 2020, LUT University has been a Finnish branch of the International Competence Centre for Mining Engineering Education under the auspices of Unesco, using the name Xplorer network. Due to the war in Ukraine in 2022, LUT University and Xplorer network together with other European flagship universities in Germany and Austria have interrupted all cooperation with the Saint Petersburg Mining University, head of the Unesco Centre.Finnish Xplorer network continues to work as an independent national and international competence centre in mining-engineering.

ORION'S KEY FIGURES FOR THE REVIEW PERIOD 1) In addition, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that EUR 0.06 (0.10) per share be distributed from the expendable fund in the distributable equity as a repayment of capital. \"Good progress continued throughout the year\" \"Orion's net sales improved throughout 2010, growing by about 10% on the previous year.\" \"There was growth in sales of key products based on Orion's own research - Stalevo Parkinson's drug, Simdax heart failure drug, Easyhaler pulmonary drugs and Precedex intensive care sedative. Notably, Precedex and Simdax showed strong growth. Precedex became one of our best-selling products during the year as its sales clearly increased.\" \"It was also a successful year for generic drugs and self-care products. We achieved good growth in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, and succeeded in increasing sales and market share in Finland, where market conditions remained very challenging ­- the Finnish market as a whole has contracted in the past two years.\" \"Our operating profit was clearly higher than last year due to the good sales. Strengthening of our market position in Europe and higher distribution costs due to growth in the volume of business operations increased fixed costs. On the other hand, research and development expenses were lower than in the previous year, because of the timing of our research projects, and administrative expenses were lower as patent litigation costs in the United States decreased.\" \"We made significant progress in research during the year. The most important individual achievement was submitting the application for marketing authorisation for the intensive care sedative dexmedetomidine to the European Medicines Agency in October. Several early-phase projects, such as alpha 2c receptor antagonist and androgen receptor antagonist research, progressed according to plan, as did the ongoing development of combined formulations to expand the Easyhaler product family. Orion is also developing a new more effective levodopa product. In line with our strategy, collaboration with research partners again reached a new phase when in early 2011 we entered into a comprehensive agreement with the US company Endo Pharmaceuticals for the discovery, development and commercialisation of assets in oncology.\" \"We believe this good progress will continue in the current year, and we estimate that our net sales and operating profit excluding non-recurring items will be slightly higher than in 2010. The outlook forecast and basis for it can be found on pages 6-7 of this report.\" On 1 April Orion commented on the US Food and Drug Administration's release published on 31 March 2010 concerning the ongoing review of the safety of Orion's drug Stalevo. On 20 April Orion announced that the initial results of the studies with dexmedetomidine were positive, and the Company planned to submit an application for marketing authorisation for the intensive care sedative to the European Medicines Agency by the end of 2010. On 22 June Orion Corporation agreed a settlement with companies belonging to the Sun Group to a dispute in which in order to defend its patents, Orion had filed a lawsuit in the United States against Sun regarding Sun's submissions of abbreviated new drug applications (\"ANDAs\") for generic versions of Orion's Comtan® and Stalevo® drugs. On 20 October Orion announced that the European Medicines Agency had initiated the review of Orion's dexmedetomidine marketing authorisation application. On 26 November the Association of Finnish Pharmacies and Orion Corporation announced Orion's purchase of a 49% stake in Pharmaservice Oy, which provides dispensing support services for pharmacies. On 15 December Orion announced that it had been informed that Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. had submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorisation to produce and market a generic version of entacapone as 200 mg dosage tablets. On 24 January Orion filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States to enforce Orion's US patent covering Comtan® against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. On 28 January Orion and Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that they had signed a novel collaboration agreement for the discovery, development and commercialisation of assets in oncology. The companies will begin development of altogether eight drug candidates, one of them in the clinical phase, by combining equal numbers of research programmes. The companies are sharing all development costs. For products arising from the development work, Orion will have the marketing rights in Europe and Russia, and Endo Pharmaceuticals in North America. Concurrently with the establishment of the partnership, Endo Pharmaceuticals has exercised its option to license the lead asset in this collaboration discovered at Orion, a novel androgen",

        "text": "Low Carbon built environment: Innovation funding call Photos: Sitowise Group Oyj A huge amount of data is generated in the urban environment, but it is not utilized efficiently. The DataMust project develops the concept of data marketplaces based on edge computing in the built environment in collaboration between several companies. The research and development work would not be possible without the funding granted by Business Finland. The project also benefits from the new kind of data marketplace and edge computing that eliminate the need to transfer data from one place to another. In the future, the same technology will be applied to other smart city solutions. \"In practice, we use the funding to develop solutions that improve the energy efficiency of the built environment and data processing. Urban carbon neutrality goals require more extensive sharing and utilization of data. To promote this, we need to build trust between various operators. The energy consumption of digital infrastructure will be reduced by using data locally without transferring it to cloud services. Both goals are based on the concept of a decentralized and local data marketplace and the related data processing services\",says Maija Federley, DataMust project leader at VTT. The DataMust project is part of Nokia's Veturi program and receives funding from Business Finland's Low-Carbon Built Environment RRF innovation funding program. The RRF funding is part of the European Union's recovery funding, which will be granted up to a total of EUR 500 million in 2021–2023. It promotes structural renewal in business and industry and the creation of a competitive edge based on Finnish companies' sustainable solutions. The Low-Carbon Built Environment funding call is open until April 14, 2023. DataMust is a Co-Innovation project: a joint project between several companies and research organizations. A total of six companies and one research organization are involved in the project. \"The starting point of Co-Innovation funding is that there is a problem in the market that companies want to solve. In this case, it was the utilization of large amounts of data,\" says Sixten Sandström, Business Finland's ecosystem lead.\"The solution must also have internationalization potential. In addition to funding, we naturally offer a wide range of help and coaching. As a small country, Finland is an excellent pilot market. We have technical expertise, and people are very ready and willing to use technology,\" Sandström says. More and more properties are generating plenty of data because they employ various sensors. Sensors can measure, for example, temperature fluctuations or air quality. Design and consulting company Sitowise Oy is one of the parties to the DataMust project. Hannu Lammi, leader of the Sitowise project, says that the RRF funding received by the company is advancing their project effectively. \"Sitowise investigates data applications and designs solutions related to buildings and their environment. The aim is to make buildings cost-effective. We develop data-based applications that improve building technology solutions in areas such as energy efficiency and ventilation. Our customers are property owners and developers, which includes cities. We are investigating how they can utilize data to influence the energy efficiency of buildings and the infrastructure outside buildings, such as street maintenance,\" explains Lammi. The more data is uploaded to the cloud, the greater the energy consumption of data centers as they crunch data. Currently, 3% of the world's energy production is used to run data centers – this is equivalent to about 50 nuclear power plants. However, even today, relatively conventional information technology has enormous computing power, and there is no need to transfer data to the cloud to ensure computing power. This means that data can be processed locally. This is called edge computing. The aim of the DataMust project is to develop a method for sharing and utilizing data that is independent of individual information systems and technologies, and to investigate incentives for operators to join the data sharing ecosystem. Other sectors may also benefit from the project, which also has global export potential for Finnish companies. The backbone of the project is the Nokia Data Marketplace, which is a marketplace for reliable data. Instead of processing data, however, it only processes contracts between buyers and sellers of data. It is secured by blockchain, and the use of the data also leaves a digital footprint. Although there are reliable ways to share data, many companies still have their prejudices. \"Organizations cling to their own data unnecessarily. Often this benefits no one. This is why companies need to understand and have a model of what data can be shared and what is worth sharing in the first place. Companies need to see how data can benefit them in the long term and which data",

Innovations, services and collaboration opportunities for researchers, businesses, alumni and donors. Carbon dioxide emissions that accelerate climate change are a wicked problem for the industry. As they cannot be completely avoided, tools to capture and recycle carbon dioxide are needed. Chemically produced superbases may offer a solution. Their potential is being surveyed by the 'Direct and reversible CO2 capture from air using superbases' project coordinated by Professor Timo Repo, for which the University of Helsinki has received more than €420,000 in Co-Research funding from Business Finland. Alongside Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, involved in the project are a significant number of business partners interested in reducing their own carbon footprint, as well as manufacturing new products from carbon dioxide. \"Carbon dioxide is often thought of solely in terms of harm, but it is also a raw material for, for example, e-fuels,\" Repo notes. Current methods of emission capture are not good enough: for example, amino alcohols can be used to collect carbon dioxide primarily from sources such as coal power plant smokestacks, after which the extraction of CO2 for further use requires a lot of energy.Superbases could be used to capture emissions directly from the air and other low-concentration sources. This way, carbon dioxide would also be extracted at a climate-friendly 60 degrees centigrade. However, the suitability of the technique for controlling industrial emissions must be investigated further. \"The goal is to validate the idea,\" Repo says. The initial results demonstrate that superbases are able to bind and release carbon dioxide, in line with the premise. Timo Repo, Professor of Chemistry, University of Helsinki Launched in spring 2023, the project is linked to the plastics manufacturer Borealis' SPIRIT programme under the Business Finland Veturi scheme, which supports the sustainability transition in the field. Borealis is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050, a goal unattainable with current emission capture techniques – they are too expensive and inefficient. \"One of our primary goals is to bring down the price of carbon capture,\" says the company's Asset Transformation Manager Mikko Rönkä. At Borealis, carbon dioxide emissions are generated especially at the stage of plastic production where hydrocarbons are heated in cracker furnaces with fuel gases. In fact, the company aims to obtain information on the combination of superbases and chemical solutions that could enable the capture of precisely such emissions. It is also interested in how little energy suffices for superbases to capture carbon dioxide. \"If we achieve a breakthrough, it will open up quite a lot of opportunities,\" Rönkä says. If, for example, emissions from burning non-recyclable plastics were recovered, they could be used to manufacture new plastic products. This would be another step towards a circular economy. \"Plastics can even be turned into carbon sinks if they are used in the long term,\" Rönkä notes. . The collaboration attracts Borealis because of the scientific expertise in superbases found in Repo's group. The University's capacity for project coordination is also important. An international business would not have time for similar efforts, nor the necessary research competencies in the specific field of carbon capture. This is why the University is an irreplaceable partner. \"All we need is to participate in the steering group activities and keep ourselves up to date with the research findings,\" Rönkä sums up. The project will continue until spring 2025. Repo and his team are responsible for the chemistry work package: they measure how much carbon dioxide can be collected and released with promising amidine- and guanidine-based superbases. The results so far confirm that the substances function as expected. \"That side is thoroughly studied and understood,\" Repo says. Other partners are investigating how to introduce the technique into their day-to-day operations. VTT is looking for ways to turn superbases into solids, while Aalto University is investigating the scalability of the process. Globally, there is a great deal of interest in superbases. If everything goes to plan, the ongoing project could contribute to revolutionising emissions control. What motivated Repo to explore the topic was pure scientific passion. \"This is one of the most enjoyable chemical phenomena I've studied in my career.\" Please contact us and we will tailor a project to your needs: business@helsinki.fi Share this article The Direct and reversible CO2 capture from air using superbases project coordinated by the University of Helsinki has received Business Finland's Co-Research funding for the period 2023–2025.

        "text": "Päivi Saavalainen, a geneticist and docent at the University of Helsinki, has together with her team developed DropPen, a small and portable device that offers a quick, easy-to-use and inexpensive solution based on droplet technology. Droplets are small emulsion drops of water mixed in oil. They are used in diagnostics and biomedical research as microscopically small reaction chambers. Droplets are utilised in, among others, digital polymerase chain reaction technology (dPCR), which helps, for example, measure very small numbers of pathogens or even individual cancer cells in clinical specimens. The technology also enables increasingly accurate analysis of cells and the culture of individual cells inside droplets. At the moment, the technique requires large, complex and slowly functioning equipment that costs tens of thousands of euros. Such equipment is not suited to rapid diagnostics. According to Saavalainen, these were the problems from which the DropPen innovation stemmed. \"We got frustrated by currently available pumps and devices that are complicated and expensive. We started considering how to generate droplets through much simpler means.\" DropPen is a single-use droplet chip in whose channel system an emulsion is formed through pressurisation with a portable and manually operated device. No separate pump equipment is needed. Reactions are carried out in the same chip, from which the results are directly scanned and analysed. Saavalainen believes that the small size and rapid functioning of the device and chip make it possible, for the first time, to develop rapid diagnostic tests. Single cell analytics will also become more widely available, which means, among other things, that DNA can be individually analysed from a large number of cells. \"Inexpensive portable equipment will also be of use to developing countries, field hospitals and field research as well as laboratories specialised in infectious diseases. It's not easy to make expensive and sizeable dPCR equipment available for them,\" she notes. DropPen is the result of three years of research and development, from single cell analytics and the fabrication of microfluidic chips to novel uses, with two projects funded by Business Finland. Päivi Saavalainen leads the Immunomics research group at the Faculty of Medicine. Alongside Saavalainen, geneticist Pinja Elomaa and chemist Benedek Poor work in the DropPen project, in addition to which cooperation is conducted with a research group headed by Christina Liedert at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and another research group at the Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT, headed by Kari Ullakko. According to Saavalainen, both the market and demand for single cell analytics and dPCR technology are seeing strong growth. She believes that the portable nature of DropPen as well as its inexpensive price offer a significant competitive edge. Another factor adding to its potential is the speed of the technique and its sensitivity in rapid testing. \"With our DropPen solution, dPCR technology could be utilised in the rapid diagnostics market,\" she says. In cooperation with VTT, the researchers are currently optimising DropPen prototypes for mass production and testing them on a range of applications. Trials with pilot customers are also being planned. The project, funded by the New Business from Research Ideas scheme of Business Finland, will run until next summer. \"After that, we will either establish a spin-out company for chip commercialisation or give other companies a licence to use the technology. We are also going to apply for a patent,\" Saavalainen says. Saavalainen says that, at the moment, the DropPen team is applying for initial seed funding as well as looking for partners in diagnostics, single cell analytics and digital imaging. dPCR and single cell analytics utilise droplet technology, but its wider use in diagnostics and in rapid testing in particular is hindered by the large size and high price of currently available equipment. DropPen offers a manually pressuriseable, portable, simple and single-use droplet chip that requires no separate pump equipment. The technology is inexpensive and fast. Thanks to its features, DropPen brings accuracy and sensitivity to rapid diagnostics, as well as broadens the application potential of single cell analytics. The combination of the chip's channel structure and the pressurising device with its technical solutions is one of a kind, with no similar competing products available on the market.

        "text": "Innovation 5 minute read What's not to like about e-fuels? Derived from captured CO2 combined with green hydrogen, they stand out as a notable prospect in the renewable fuels arena. The technology for e-fuels already exists, but crafting a feasible value chain for mass production requires keen technological acumen and a tightly knit network of partnerships. This is what Neste and partner companies have demonstrated at VTT's Bioruukki Pilot Centre in Espoo, Finland. Neste 2023-10-30T00:00+02:00 Imagine a world where airplanes, trucks, and ships run on electrofuels – also known as e-fuels – made from renewable hydrogen that is produced by green electricity and captured CO2. With Power-to-X technology, greenhouse gas that could have exacerbated global warming is converted into e-crude using green hydrogen. This e-crude can then be refined into carbon-neutral fuels for such fields of transportation that are difficult to electrify directly. \"To achieve global climate goals, all sustainable solutions are needed. Power-to-X based solutions, such as e-fuels, have the potential to reduce emissions in the transportation sector beyond renewable fuels based on biomass,\" explains Dietmar Huber, Vice President of Power-to-X Innovation Business Platform at Neste. Power-to-X technolo is promising, but it is not without obstacles. One of the main challenges has been constructing a value chain that positions e-fuels as a viable contender in the renewable fuels landscape. Welcome to the future! VTT Bioruukki Pilot Centre is a redbrick house close to nature at the far edge of the city of Espoo in Finland. Behind the unassuming facade lies an advanced pilot line that is demonstrating how e-fuels could be manufactured for industrial scale. Here, headed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and joined by fifteen industry partners, Neste is one of the collaborators in a venture that integrates multiple production units for e-fuels. \"After almost three years' of close cooperation, we've successfully achieved a small-scale integration of the entire PtX value chain,\" Huber reveals. The E-Fuel research and development project at Bioruukki is one of Neste Veturi program's many research collaborations. The program develops sustainable fuels and chemicals from renewable and recycled raw materials, such as lignocellulose, algae, waste plastics, renewable hydrogen and CO2. Many of these raw materials have been difficult to utilize in the past, and this is directly reflected in the value chain creation. \"Partnering is key to building a viable Power-to-X value chain,\" says Juha Lehtonen, Research Professor at VTT. \"We need different types of expertise, starting from renewable energy and CO2 capture to electrolysis technology and refining e-crude.\" The E-Fuel project in Bioruukki has done just that: integrated various technologies for high-temperature electrolysis, capturing CO2, and hydrocarbon synthesis. One of the breakthroughs of the project has been uniting three key technological solutions: solid oxide electrolysis (SOEC, by Convion system with Elcogen stack technology), Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FT, by Ineratec and VTT technology and catalysts), and water-based CO2 capture (by CarbonReUse Finland and Andritz technology). The The SOEC technology works at high temperatures and is much more efficient at producing hydrogen from electricity compared to alternative methods like alkaline and PEM electrolysis technologies. \"In the pilot, novel solutions and applications based on some existing technologies are tested and further improved for e-fuel production, paving the way for commercial scale applications. Next steps are to evaluate the overall feasibility of the process and look for options to scale up,\" Lehtonen says. \"It's a milestone that's speeding up the process of making drop-in paraffinic e-fuels and other PtX products commercially available,\" Huber agrees. The collaboration has not just been about checking off boxes. It has been about learning, iterating on findings, and working together to reach a common goal. Tuning into the right kind of can-do frame of mind. \"I'm glad to witness Neste's commitment to investing and participating in the entire value chain,\" Lehtonen says. \"We have maintained honest and active communication with all partners openly sharing our thoughts in regular meetings. Generous knowledge sharing and our collective ability to overcome challenges by solving problems together are among key take-aways of the project,\" Lehtonen says. Another learning opportunity has been the integration of different process units in the pilot that gained all involved valuable know-how. \"Multiple actors were involved in the integration, each with their own equipment. Despite some delays, we were able to successfully integrate the system,\" he continues. \"Collaboration is one key factor in achieving success, as proven in this project. A wide spectrum of experti",

        "text": "The European Union has recently announced a bold plan to become independent from Russian fossil fuels and accelerate the green transition in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The plan, called REPowerEU, includes a solar energy strategy that sets ambitious targets and initiatives for the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels across the bloc. One of the most significant initiatives is the introduction of a legally binding EU solar rooftop obligation that will ensure the installation of solar panels on buildings. According to the European Commission, this obligation will apply to: Source On the 8th of December 2023, the Ministry of the Environment of the Finnish Government released an official article: According to the provisional agreement, there would be strengthened requirements on the number of recharging points in both residential and non-residential buildings. Pre-cabling would become the norm for new and renovated buildings, thus facilitating access to recharging infrastructure. All new residential and non-residential buildings should have zero on-site emissions from fossil fuels as of 1 January 2028. Solar electricity systems should be gradually installed starting from 2027 where this is technically, economically and functionally feasible. Member States would also have to increase measures with the aim to completely phase-out of fossil fuels in heating and cooling by 2040. But why should commercial building owners and managers in Finland comply with this obligation? What are the benefits and challenges of installing solar PV systems on commercial rooftops? And how can they prepare for this transition? In this blog post, I will try to answer these questions and provide some insights and tips on how to make the most of the EU solar mandate for commercial buildings in Finland. Installing solar PV systems on commercial rooftops can bring multiple benefits for building owners and managers, as well as for the environment and society. Some of these benefits are: - Reduced energy bills: Solar PV systems can generate electricity that can be used to power the building's appliances, lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, reducing the need to buy electricity from the grid. Depending on the size and location of the system, the electricity generation profile, and the electricity tariff, solar PV systems can save up to 50% of the electricity costs for commercial buildings, according to a study by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. - Increased property value: Solar PV systems can increase the attractiveness and value of commercial properties, as they demonstrate environmental responsibility, reduce operating costs, and improve energy performance ratings. A study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US found that home buyers were willing to pay a premium of about 4% for homes with solar PV systems. A similar effect could be expected for commercial properties, especially in light of the EU's energy performance certificates (EPCs) scheme, which rates buildings according to their energy efficiency and carbon emissions. - Reduced carbon footprint: Solar PV systems can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from commercial buildings by displacing fossil fuel-based electricity from the grid. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), solar PV systems can avoid about 0.5 kg of CO2 emissions per kWh of electricity generated. This means that a typical 100 kWp solar PV system installed on a commercial rooftop in Finland could avoid about 40 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year, equivalent to taking about 9 cars off the road. - Enhanced reputation: Solar PV systems can enhance the reputation and image of commercial buildings and their occupants, as they signal their commitment to sustainability, innovation, and social responsibility. This can improve customer loyalty, employee satisfaction, stakeholder relations, and brand value. A survey by Nielsen found that 66% of global consumers are willing to pay more for products and services from companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact. Despite these benefits, installing solar PV systems on commercial rooftops also poses some challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. Some of these challenges are: - High upfront costs: Solar PV systems require a significant initial investment that can deter some building owners and managers from adopting them. The average cost of installing a solar PV system on a commercial rooftop in Finland is about €1.2 per Wp, according to SolarPower Europe. This means that a typical 100 kWp system would cost about €120,000. However, this cost can be reduced by taking advantage of various incentives and financing options available in Finland and in the EU (see below). - Complex permitting procedures: Solar PV systems need to obtain various permits and approvals from different authorities before they can be installed and connected to the grid. These include building permits, e",

        "text": "Ensto Flow mahdollistaa kokeilemisen ja yhteistyön, joilla voidaan rakentaa asioita, jotka eivät sovi Enston tavanomaiseen liiketoimintamalliin. Jotkin kokeiluista voivat jopa johtaa ihmiskunnan parempaan selviytymiseen. Kertoessaan Ensto Flow'n missiosta Visa Parviainen kuulostaa hieman kapteeni James Tiberius Kirkiltä: \"Tehdä rohkeasti jotain, mikä ei tunnu luontevalta kokeneelle teollisuusalan toimijalle.\" Parviainen on Ensto Digital Solutions -liiketoiminta-alueen teknologiajohtaja. Tehtävässään hän valvoo Enston teknologiastrategiaa ja tunnistaa tilanteita, joissa on mahdollista rakentaa synergioita. Ohjelmistoinsinöörinä Parviainen tulee perinteisen valmistavan teollisuuden ulkopuolelta. Hän tuli Enstolle loppuvuodesta 2017 auttaakseen luomaan ympäristön, jossa hänen sanojensa mukaan \"epäonnistumisia ei ainoastaan hyväksytä, vaan niitä myös arvostetaan silloin, kun ne estävät Enstoa viemästä eteenpäin vääränlaisia projekteja.\" Ensto Flow'n keskiössä on auttaa yhtiötä tekemään päätöksiä siitä, miten Enston tuotteiden tulisi viestiä muun maailman kanssa. \"Olemme perinteisesti tuotteita tarjoava yritys\", sanoo Parviainen, \"mutta meidän on tehtävä asiakkaalle helpoksi valita tuotteen lisäksi kokonaisratkaisu.\" Tehdäänkö kaikesta siis älykästä? Parviaisen mukaan on myös tuotteita, kuten liittimet, joihin ei sisällytetä älytoimintoja. Mutta tällä hetkellä hyvin yksinkertaisistakin tuotteista, kuten johdonsuojakatkaisijoista, voitaisiin kuitenkin tehdä älykkäitä. \"Silloin ne voivat kertoa meille itse, ovatko kunnossa vai onko jotain vialla. Kaikilla matalajännitetuotteillamme, kuten muuntajilla ja tasasuuntaimilla, tulee olemaan kyky viestiä. Samoin sähkölinjan kaikilla muilla elektroniikkaa sisältävillä komponenteilla.\" Flow tarjoaa kaksi polkua. Prototyyppipolku tarjoaa ympäristön epätavallisille kokeiluille, joilla ei välttämättä ole mitään välitöntä tuotesovellusta. \"Voimme tehdä yhteistyötä toisten yritysten kanssa ja oppia kumpikin jotain, mikä olisi ollut mahdotonta tai kallista oppia yksin\", sanoo Parviainen. Integrointipolussa on kyse viestintäkäyttöliittymillä varustettujen laitteiden luomisesta. Tällöin kehitetään tuotteita muille yrityksille, jotka saattaisivat haluta sisällyttää laitteen osaksi omia ratkaisujaan tavoilla, joita Ensto ei ole osannut vielä edes kuvitella. Kyseessä olisi siis toisten yritysten tuotteet, jotka keskustelevat Enston tuotteiden kanssa. \"Emme myönnä yksinoikeutta palvelurajapintojemme [API eli Application Programming Interfaces] käyttöön, joten niitä voivat käyttää monet yritykset\", sanoo Parviainen. \"Näin siirrymme kohti laitteiden ekosysteemiä.\" Flow'n ensimmäiset tutkimukset on tehty prototyyppien kehittämisen alueella. Ensto solmi vastikään kumppanuudet Ericssonin ja DNA:n kanssa varmistaakseen, että sähköautojen latausmodeemeissa käytetyt radiotekniikat eivät vanhentuisi. Kokeilu, jota Parviainen luonnehti \"erittäin tekniseksi ja paljon pintaa syvemmälle luotaavaksi\", tehtiin Enston tutkimuslaboratoriossa Porvoossa. Myöhemmin prototyyppi esiteltiin Sähkö Tele Valo AV -messuilla Jyväskylässä, missä sillä testattiin lataustoimintoja kytkemällä se sähköauton lataussimulaattoriin. \"Ericsson tarjosi käyttöön asiantuntemuksensa ja lainasi meille fyysiset modeemit, ja testasimme laitetta DNA:n Cat M1 -verkossa\", sanoo Parviainen. Ensto ei suunnittele korvaavansa nykyistä modeemisukupolveaan välittömästi, mutta halusi varmistaa mahdollisuuden siihen, jos tarvetta ilmenisi. Epäonnistuminen oli tämän kokeilun mahdollinen lopputulema. \"Olisimme saattaneet todeta, että yhteensopivuus olisi vaatinut suuria investointeja tai että modeemiemme kotelot eivät olleet yhteensopivia tiettyjen radiotaajuuksien kanssa. Selvisi kuitenkin, että se toimii, ja voimme halutessamme käynnistää tuotteen kehitystyön.\" Ensto Flow osallistuu myös huomattavan yhteiskunnallisen merkityksen omaaviin projekteihin, joissa tulevat kaupalliset sovellukset voivat olla vielä täysin hämärän peitossa. Esimerkiksi Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT tekee tutkimusta mustasotilaskärpäsen toukkien käytöstä orgaanisen jätteen muuntamisessa proteiiniksi eläinrehua varten. Ensto tuli mukaan projektiin luodakseen etä-ohjattavan lämmitysratkaisun merikonteille, joissa kärpäsiä kasvatetaan. \"Tämä on uusi suunta tekniikalle, ja meidän on hyvä ymmärtää, missä ympäristöissä tuotteitamme käytetään\", Parviainen kertoo. \"Emme tietenkään aio aloittaa toukkien kasvatuskonttien valmistusta! Flow auttaa siirtymään kohti kiertotaloutta, missä biojätettä, jonka arvo on erittäin matala, muutetaan proteiinirehuksi, jonka arvo on verrattain korkea. Se, että asioiden arvo voidaan säilyttää, on ihmiskunnan pitkän tähtäimen selviämisen edellytys. Enstolle välitön hyöty on siinä, että k",

        "text": "The initiative will pioneer low-carbon, water-efficient technology with the potential to reduce water consumption by up to 90% and overall energy consumption by more than half. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland announces a new initiative to address the challenges of energy and resource consumption in the forestry and textile industry. The goal of the Energy First initiative is to act as a starting point for an entirely new technology, which creates the conditions for the manufacture of low-carbon, energy-efficient, and recyclable fiber-based products. With the continued growth of, for example, global e-commerce, the demand for various fiber-based packaging solutions is projected to grow 5–10% annually, according to data from Statista Market Insights and eMarketer. As such, there is a need to develop scalable, high-quality packaging that is easy to recycle while simultaneously significantly reducing carbon footprint. Within non-wovens, used in napkins and wipes for example, VTT expects a strong shift from traditional products that contain plastic to cellulose-based products. With a budget of around 20 million euros over the next four years, the initiative consists of several projects and will establish a new innovative open-access pilot line in Jyväskylä, Finland. The collaborative research aims at developing and testing commercially viable, sustainable alternatives for cardboard packaging, hygiene products, and non-woven fabrics. \"This new initiative is a pivotal step towards more sustainable and competitive fiber-based products, and has the potential for great impact, thanks to more than 50 industrial partners. We are excited about the prospect of 1:1 commercial projects with companies, driving innovation in energy-efficient paper board production. VTT's purpose is to bring together people, business, science and technology, paving the way to a sustainable future. The Energy First theme aims to do just that,\" says Atte Virtanen, Vice President, Biomaterial Processing and Products at VTT. The forest industry faces new challenges, including the rising cost of energy and fiberwood scarcity. The Energy First theme seeks to overcome these hindrances to sustainable products by developing a manufacturing process with minimal water and energy usage. Preliminary estimates by VTT's scientists suggest that the new manufacturing process will provide a potential reduction of up to 90% in water consumption and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. Overall, the goal is to reduce energy consumption by up to 50%. Products manufactured with the new process are designed to be compatible with existing recycling methods. Furthermore, fiber-based packaging is produced in a way that makes it a sustainable alternative to reusable packaging. The planned EU packaging and packaging directive requires that both the raw material and the manufacturing process are sustainable, and recyclable bio-based packaging solutions will have to undergo a sustainability assessment. In addition to reducing water and energy consumption, the project seeks to redefine the forest industry's environmental impact and enhance the competitiveness of fiber-based products. For example, by making the products lighter, more products could be produced for consumer use from the same amount of wood, which improves resource efficiency. \"The Energy First Consortium project has several captivating work packages that align closely with Valmet's current research and development objectives. Energy efficiency, investing novel 3D fiber-based structures, and the strength of fiber products are closely aligned with Valmet's current research and development objectives. The program's global collaboration network ensures that any intriguing project findings can be swiftly implemented in practice,\" says Sampo Immonen, R&D Director, Valmet. The equipment for the pilot project will be supplied by Anpap Oy. Anpap designs, manufactures and supplies airlaid technology and machinery. \"We feel that the Energy First project is one of the first steps in unlocking the full potential of airlaid technology in sustainable single-use and durable product categories. Anpap has set the benchmark for the airlaid industry for the past 40 years, and we have a strong commitment to keep developing the technology to enable the transition to next-generation sustainable products. Compared to wetlaid, airlaid web forming is flexible and consumes dramatically less natural resources, such as water, which reduces the environmental impact of manufacturing and while satisfying the needs of consumers,\" says Tuukka Vihtakari, CTO, Anpap. The initiative is funded by EU, ERDF, VTT and the collaborating companies. The consortium is also actively engaging in EU projects, such as EU SteamDry, with a total budget of 9.84 million euros over 3.5 years. VTT will actively continue developing new projects as a part of the initiative including bilateral cooperation with industrial par",

STARDUST osallistui IoT-alustan hankintaan sekä hyödynsi alustaa datan keräämiseen, seurantaan ja visualisointiin. IoT-alustan avulla ohjataan nyt ulkovalaistusta, tarkkaillaan keskustan kevyen liikenteen määriä ja kerätään monenlaista tietoa päätöksenteon tueksi. Projektin aikana Tampereen uudelle Ilokkaanpuiston asuinalueelle rakennettiin myös Suomen energiatehokkaimpia asuinkerrostaloja, jotka omistavat yhdessä Teiskossa sijaitsevan aurinkovoimalan. Ilokkaanpuiston konsepti on ainutlaatuinen Suomessa. Hankkeen alussa haastettiin silloin voimassa ollut lainsäädäntö. Aiemmin laki vaati, että oman auringontuotannon piti sijaita samalla tontilla kuin rakennukset. Lainsäädäntö kuitenkin muuttui 2018, jolloin myös muualla kuin omalla tontilla sijaitsevat uusituvan energian lähteet sallittiin energiatodistuslaskennassa. Tampereen Energian kanssa toteutettu kaukolämmön älyohjauksen kokeilu toi merkittäviä säästöjä. Älyohjaus on säästänyt kiinteistöissä keskimäärin 8,4 prosenttia kaukolämmön energiankulutuksesta. Kerrostaloissa säästö on ollut 18,6 prosenttia perusmaksuista. Älykkään lämmityksen ohjauksen pilottipalvelun alustana toimi Enermixin Talotohtori. Liikkumisen hiilijalanjälkilaskuri on osa kaupungin maksutonta Tampere.Finland-sovellusta. Sen avulla käyttäjät voivat seurata oman arkiliikkumisensa hiilijalanjälkeä ja sen vaikutusta terveyteen. Laskuri tunnistaa tehdyn matkan automaattisesti. Kestävää liikkumista tuettiin seuraamalla ensimmäisten sähköbussien energiankulutusta ja selviämistä talvisissa olosuhteissa. Lisäksi Hervantaan tarjottiin autonomisen liikkumisen testialueen toimijoille 3D-muotoinen digitaalinen kaksonen eli tarkka kolmiulotteinen kopio alueesta. Digitaalinen kaksonen mahdollistaa älykkään ja automaattisen liikkumisen palveluiden, kuten robottiautojen, testaamisen virtuaalisesti ennen niiden siirtymistä fyysiselle testialueelle. – Laajana ja pitkäkestoisena projektina STARDUST on tukenut hienosti Tampereen tavoitetta olla hiilineutraali kaupunki vuoteen 2030 mennessä, toteaa ilmasto- ja ympäristöpäällikkö Laura Inha Tampereen kaupungilta ja jatkaa: projektin pilottikohteilla pystyttiin aidosti edistämään uusia ja haastavia kehityskohteita, jotka jäävät käyttöön projektin päätyttyäkin. Tampereella projektin toteuttivat vuosina 2017–2024 Tampereen kaupunki, Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT Oy, Tampereen Energia, Skanska Oy sekä pk-yritykset Enermix Oy ja Aurinkotekno Oy. – Tulokset eivät olisi olleet mahdollisia ilman lukuisia yhteistyökumppaneja, ja haluankin kiittää heitä kaikkia hyvästä yhteistyöstä, sanoo projektipäällikkö Anna Vilhula Tampereen kaupungilta. Tampereen pilotit toteutettiin rinnakkain Espanjan Pamplonan ja Italian Trenton kaupunkien kanssa. Oppia otettiin puolin ja toisin, koska sekä ratkaistavat kysymykset että ratkaisut ovat lopulta samanlaisia pohjoisessa ja eteläisessä Euroopassa. Oppeja jaettiin myös projektin seuraajakaupunkeihin Kreikassa, Pohjois-Irlannissa ja Romaniassa.

        "text": "Wärtsilä, a leading supplier of flexible power plants for the decentralized power generation market, has successfully performed a number of tests that demonstrate the ability of its engines to run on a range of vegetable and animal-based oils. This enables a wider range of renewable fuel options for the Wärtsilä engines, while at the same time enabling further CO2 emission reductions. In the tests, conducted between February and April of this year at the VTT technical research centre in Espoo, Finland, a Wärtsilä Vasa 4R32 engine successfully operated on jatropha oil, fish oil and chicken oil. The first tests with engines running on a liquid biofuel were carried out in 1995, when Wärtsilä began testing with rapeseed oil. Since 2003, Wärtsilä engine power plants have been in commercial operation using palm oil as the fuel source. Wärtsilä has, as an example, a market share of more than 95% in Italy for power generation from liquid biofuels. The aim of these recent tests has been to assess the capability of engines to operate on renewable fuels that do not compete with agricultural uses. Commenting on the future market for power plants running on liquid biofuels, Vesa Riihimäki, Vice President, Power Plant Technology said: \"Liquid biofuels represent an emerging market. We see that fuel supply infrastructures for crude vegetable oils are being developed at an increasing pace, suggesting that the availability of such fuels will be vastly extended during the next 5 to 10 years. We provide technology that can use these new fuels, and we have demonstrated that the chain from fuel to electricity exists. In addition to commodity fuels, we see a significant potential in industry process side streams, such as, fish and chicken oils, which can used for generating renewable energy.\" Jatropha oil holds great promise The first engine test with straight jatropha oil was performed in January 2009, with the engine being operated successfully on a batch of oil delivered from India. Jatropha oil is extracted from the seeds of the jatropha plant. The seeds are a non-edible, high-energy fruit grown on semi-arid or marginal land in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The fact that jatropha oil cannot be used in the food industry, makes it extremely promising as a future fuel source. An additional test will be conducted later this summer on a further batch of jatropha oil imported from Tanzania. In April last year, Wärtsilä secured an order for an engine-based power plant that will run on jatropha oil at the Koekhoven combined heat and power plant in Merksplas, Belgium. This plant, which is expected to start operation this autumn, will be the first commercial installation of an engine running on the fuel. Good results on animal oil Fish oil has been tested in February 2009. Fish contains 10-30% oil or fat, depending on the species. The global production of fish oil in 2007 was 1.1 million tonnes, exceeding the amount needed for food supplements. Tests showed that the engine performed in much the same way as when running on vegetable-based oils, and no further testing will be necessary for evaluation purposes at this stage. Chicken oil, a by-product of the rendering process of chicken, was tested in April 2009. During the test, the engine performed as expected. From these tests, it can be concluded that most animal fats are similar to conventional diesel fuels in terms of energy content, and ignition and combustion properties. The main differences are the melting point, the level of impurities, and the degree of acidity. The main aim of the tests was to gain some experience with alternative fuels, and to verify that the engines would behave as expected in terms of performance and exhaust gas emissions. Niklas Haga, Chief Development Engineer, Wärtsilä Power Plants commented: \"We have successfully tested and operated our engines using various vegetable-based oils in the past, now we are in the process of looking at animal-based oils. As a result of these tests, we are confident that we can operate our current engines on these renewables.\" Mr Riihimäki continues: \"In the future, we will pursue further opportunities in the fuels arena, with a target to provide even more fuel flexibility to our customers.\" For further information, please contact: Vesa Riihimäki Vice President, Power Plant Technology, Wärtsilä Power Plants Tel: +358 40 504 5229 e-mail: vesa.riihimaki@wartsila.com Maria Nystrand Publicity Manager, Wärtsilä Power Plants Direct tel: +358 10 709 1456 e-mail: maria.nystrand@wartsila.com Wärtsilä in brief Wärtsilä is a global leader in complete lifecycle power solutions for the marine and energy markets.

        "text": "Ensto Flow allows experimentation and collaboration to build things that don't fit neatly into Ensto's usual business model. And some of the experiments may even contribute to long-term human survival. When he talks about the mission of Ensto Flow, Visa Parviainen can sound like Captain James Tiberius Kirk: \"To bravely do something that doesn't come naturally to an established industrial player.\" Parviainen is Ensto's Chief Technology Officer for Digital Solutions, and his role is to oversee Ensto's technology strategy and identify situations where synergies can be built. A software engineer Parviainen comes from outside the usual manufacturing ecosystem, and he joined Ensto in late 2017 to help create an environment where, as he puts it, \"failure is not only protected, but it's celebrated when it keeps Ensto from chasing the wrong projects.\" At the core of Ensto Flow is helping decide how Ensto products should communicate to the outside world. \"We're a product company traditionally,\" says Parviainen, \"but we need to make it easy for a customer to choose an end-to-end solution for a given product.\" So will everything be made smart? Parviainen says there are products, like couplers, that won't have smartness embedded. But products like circuit breakers, which are currently quite simple, could indeed be made smart. \"They can tell us 'Am I tripped or am I okay?' All our low-voltage products like transformers and rectifiers will be able to communicate. And all active components down the line — anything with electronics — will have the option for communication.\" Flow offers two tracks. The prototyping track provides an environment for unusual experiments that don't necessarily have an immediate product application. \"We can work together with other companies and both learn something that would have been impossible or expensive to learn alone,\" says Parviainen. The integration track is about creating devices with communications interfaces that other companies may want to incorporate into their own solutions in ways Ensto hasn't yet imagined – other companies' products talking to Ensto's. \"We don't grant exclusivity on use of our APIs\" [Application Programming Interfaces], says Parviainen, \"so there can be many companies using them. This is us moving toward ecosystems of devices.\" Flow's first case studies have been in the area of prototyping. Ensto recently partnered with Ericsson and DNA, the Finnish telecommunications company, to ensure the radio communications technologies employed in EV charging modems don't become obsolete. The experiment, which Parviainen characterizes as \"highly technical and far under the hood,\" took place in the Ensto lab in Porvoo. Later, the prototype was taken public at the Sähkö Tele Valo AV exhibition (electrical equipment fair) in Jyväskylä, Finland, where it was connected to an EV simulator to test charging transactions. \"Ericsson provided the expertise and loaned us the physical modems, and we tested it on DNA's Cat M1 network,\" says Parviainen. Ensto is not looking to immediately replace its current generation of modems but wanted to validate the possibility if the need arose. Failure might have been an outcome in this case. \"We might have determined that a heavy investment in compatibility was in order, or that our modem enclosures weren't compatible with certain radio frequencies. However, we found that it works and when we want to we can start developing it.\" Ensto Flow also takes part in projects of major societal importance, where future commercial applications may be nebulous. For example, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland is researching the use of black soldier fly larvae to convert organic waste into protein for animal feed. Ensto entered the project to create a remotely controllable heating solution for sea containers where the flies are bred. \"It's a new direction of technology, and it's good for us to understand what environments our products are used,\" says Parviainen. \"We're of course not going to start producing containers to grow larvae, but Flow provides the opportunity to help work toward a circular economy, where low-value matter streams are turned into a highvalue streams. That the value of things doesn't decrease as they get used in a process is a requirement for longterm human survival. For Ensto, the immediate benefit is taking a set of quite traditional products into a challenging environment to see if we can accommodate them as we delve further into remote control and sensors in our products. \"A home for great ideas and learning and weird stuff that doesn't neatly fit into the traditional business model\" is Parviainen's description of Ensto Flow. As Ensto continues to make its products smart, the line between traditional and weird will continue to blur. \"In a year Ensto Flow will look different than it does now,\" says Parviainen. \"",

The new nonwoven has passed European Standard EN 14683:2019 Type II requirements in terms of filtration efficiency and pressure drop. \"Our FIBRELLA® Shield nonwoven has excellent filtration efficiency and pressure drop values meaning that the material provides protection while being comfortable and easy to breathe through. Measured with an applied method by VTT* results indicate that FIBRELLA® Shield nonwoven's filtration efficiency is higher than 99% reaching type II requirements but of course the material can also be used for lighter model Type I masks or uncertified masks,\" says Category Manager Johanna Sirén. \"FIBRELLA® Shield has received positive feedback from several user panel tests about its textile-like softness and being odorless. The panel results show also that FIBRELLA® Shield is comfortable to use even for several hours and it doesn't build up moisture during use,\" Johanna Sirén continues. The standard EN14683:2019 for medical masks is for end products and the converter has to repeat the tests to confirm the standard compliancy for the end product. The end product needs to comply also with the regional regulations, if any. Developed in cooperation with VTT, this new material is the latest addition to the FIBRELLA® family. FIBRELLA® Shield is already in production at Suominen's Nakkila plant. Currently the plant is capable of producing material for approximately 15 million masks per month.

When asked what the Ambassador was particularly hoping to see during his visit to Oulu, he said: \"We hope to observe industry-academia-government collaboration and cooperation in wireless communication technology and other cutting-edge ICT technologies. We also hope to see the local activities that form the soil for such cooperation.\" Fittingly, the journey continued to Linnanmaa, where the Ambassador and his delegation visited the PrintoCent research and development Centre at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The guests had an introduction to the PrintoCent operations and were given a tour of the centre, including the printed intelligence pilot factory. \"We are interested in how the University of Oulu, Oulu University of Applied Sciences, companies, the City of Oulu (BusinessOulu), and related facilities work together as organizations,\" the Ambassador stated. Before Linnanmaa, the Embassy invited the Finland-Japan Association of Oulu for lunch in Restaurant Rauhala, a beautiful historical wooden house, in order to praise the representatives of the association, including founders and current board members, for their continuous efforts of more than 35 years' activities between Oulu/Finland and Japan. While in Linnanmaa, the guests were then shown around Oulu University of Applied Sciences along with its Business Corner and the Oulu Game Lab, which has signed a collaboration agreement with the City of Sendai in Japan, before visiting the University of Oulu Innovation Centre. Besides the centre, the party was also introduced to the Yokohama National University branch office in Oulu. A prestigious delegation's visit to Oulu would not be complete without being initiated into the secrets and local expertise in wireless communications. Hence, the programme continued with an introduction to the 6G Flagship research and discussion about the global R&D situation concerning 6G, as well as the status of Finnish-Japanese cooperation around the topic. The in-depth visit was hosted by Research Director, Dr. Marja Matinmikko-Blue and Director Government Relations & Public Affairs Iina Peltonen of the 6G Flagship. The opening day of the Ambassador's visit ended with dinner in the company of some Japanese residents of Oulu, hosted by the Embassy of Japan. \"We are very interested in the daily lives and activities of Japanese people living in Oulu,\" the Ambassador explained. According to Ambassador Fujimura's wishes, also the second day's programme of his visit involved a lot of high technology. \"I was especially attracted to Oulu because of the city's national and international reputation for high-tech innovation, which is vividly depicted in the book 'Oulun ihmeen tekijät',\" said the Ambassador. Naturally, the guests were then escorted to Rusko for an introduction and tour of the local Nokia site, including Nokia Flagship Over-the-air laboratory OTAVA. The Ambassador was hosted by Ecosystem Manager at Nokia & 5G Test Network Lead Olli Liinamaa, Engineer Kenichi Komatsu, and Engineer Jere Aallikko. The Japanese delegation at Nokia Flagship Over-the-air laboratorio OTAVA. After the Nokia visit, the Ambassador was greeted at lunch by representatives of the City of Oulu, including Chair of City Executive Board of Oulu Mirja Vehkaperä, BusinessOulu Head of Key Accounts and Investments Olli Löytynoja, and Head of Public Relations and Protocol at City of Oulu Outi Rouru, along with Mill Director and Managing Director of Stora Enso Oulu Oy Juha Mäkimattila.

        "text": "Energy and maritime are two traditionally male-dominated industries. According to the International Energy Agency, women make up only 22% of the total workforce in the energy sector globally. In maritime, the share is even lower. This is not surprising, as women and girls remain widely underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields (STEM), and as a result, are left out of the creation, use and regulation of technology. The stereotype of women not being suited to study and pursue careers in tech, is still alive and well. The lack of inclusion diminishes the transformative potential of technology and whole industries' potential for positive and sustainable change. On International Women's Day 2023, the United Nations is drawing attention to just that with their campaign DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality, highlighting the need for inclusion in technology. Companies and industries play a crucial role in tackling the stereotypes and promoting gender equality. This year at Wärtsilä, we celebrated International Women's Day early with our event \"Innovating sustainable societies and metaverse\", showing how women are making a difference. Together with Women in Tech Finland network, we had the joy to welcome three amazing speakers: Malin Östman and Heli Etuaro from Wärtsilä and Laura Olin joining us from ZOAN. All three shared their career journeys and unique perspectives on their respective fields: energy, maritime and metaverse! Malin Östman heads Strategy and Business Development at Wärtsilä Energy and is soon celebrating her 10-year anniversary with the company. Over the years she has worked in different roles and has been able to meet people around the world and truly understand the need for affordable, reliable and sustainable energy. \"Power is a lifeline for people, communities and society as a whole - everybody needs electricity. Globally, the energy sector also plays a crucial role in reducing emissions and achieving net zero, and could do so relatively quickly\", she points out. \"Towards a 100% renewable energy future\" has been Wärtsilä Energy's mission already for over five years and Östman's organisation currently leads the way in showing how this can be achieved. \"We do power system modelling to understand the power systems in different countries and areas on a really detailed level. This has really deepened our own understanding and what role we can play in helping to develop these systems.\" Through this understanding, Wärtsilä Energy has identified the most common path towards 100% renewable energy system. The path of course varies by country, but could often start by adding renewables and balancing capacity, then move onto phasing out inflexible plants, converting to sustainable fuels and lastly, phasing out fossil fuels. \"This change needs to be managed carefully. In the energy industry, we talk about the energy trilemma: energy should be affordable, reliable and sustainable\", she explains. \"Some countries could easily jump straight to phasing out fossils, but in many emerging countries, where I've worked for most of my career, we need to have a foundation of the new power systems first.\" Power is a lifeline for people, communities and society as a whole - everybody needs electricity. Heli Etuaro is a Senior Digital Solutions Manager at Wärtsilä Marine Power, in charge of our Fleet Optimisation Solutions, that help to optimise everyday processes of ships to unlock efficiency and sustainability. Her career has taken her through many interesting challenges combining technology and management, but it all started in her childhood, where she was emerged in tech from a very young age. \"My father, uncle and godfather all worked for the same tech company and every year our whole family was invited to their Christmas parties, where the office was like an amusement park. We also got the first computer as it came out, and my favourite thing was to play with it\", she remembers. Family is also what keeps her motivated. \"Kids are so smart and aware these days. My 14-year-old daughter asked me one day, 'Mom, why is your generation destroying the world?' And I want to show that I care.\" Care for the world and our customers is also at the heart of Etuaro's work with fleet optimisation. \"By deploying digital technologies in shipping, maritime could reduce emissions by 38% by 2050 – for a fleet of 50 vessels, emissions could be reduced by 100,000 tons of CO2 annually.\" Unfortunately, the industry is a little bit behind on its digital journey, with over 90% of the data gathered during each journey never even leaving the deck – meaning that the valuable insights key for optimising journeys, increasing efficiency and reducing emissions, are lost. \"A lot of work remains to be done, but it makes me so happy, that I can show to my kids that there are solutions already today and people who are worki",

        "text": "How can we collectively accelerate the recycling of packaging? What kinds of packaging are sustainable for the future? And how can we make recycling more convenient for consumers? These key questions, among others, were explored during Huhtamaki's panel discussion at the SuomiAreena societal discussion festival in Pori, Finland, in late June. How food is packaged and what happens to the packaging afterward have significant global impacts. In the SuomiAreena panel discussion Henna Virkkunen, Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and candidate for commissioner, Ali Harlin, research professor at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Nina Elomaa, Chief Sustainability Officer at SOK (S-ryhmä / S-group), and Salla Ahonen, Executive Vice President of Sustainability and Communications at Huhtamaki, shared valuable insights on sustainable packaging and how to accelerate packaging recycling. They agreed that there is no single solution that fits all; instead, the entire value chain must collaborate to build a functioning circular system. Henna Virkkunen stressed the need for a sustainable economic model on multiple levels and highlighted the importance of self-sufficiency. By avoiding waste of raw materials and leveraging local resources, we can mitigate the risks associated with long and complex supply chains. \"We need to achieve a more sustainable economic model from economic, environmental and social perspectives. Currently, we in Finland and Europe are dependent on various imported raw materials, which is an unsustainable model for the future. We constantly need new fossil raw materials that we use and then discard. It is sensible to reuse raw materials as efficiently as possible to ensure no waste is generated in the future,\" she emphasized. The panel discussion presented recent findings from a consumer survey on packaging material recycling. Commissioned by Huhtamaki and conducted by the independent research company Aula Research, the survey revealed that 80% of Finnish consumers are satisfied with their recycling habits. However, the actual recycling rate stands at approximately 40%. This gap highlights the need to make recycling more convenient and user-friendly for consumers. \"When recycling is easy and accessible, individuals are more likely to participate. If it's straightforward to sort waste and transport it to a recycling point, people will do it. Convenience in daily life is the critical factor,\" reminded Nina Elomaa.The panelists stressed that eliminating packaging is not a feasible option and highlighted the primary function of packaging: protecting the products. Fit-for-purpose packaging safeguards food during transport and extends its shelf life, thereby helping to prevent food waste, which globally contributes to approximately 10 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. Collection infrastructure and distances play a key role in how convenient it is for consumers to recycle. Clear instructions and labelling on packaging are also crucial to help consumers sort their packaging correctly after use. A third key aspect is packaging design, which significantly influences recycling efficiency. For example, packaging made from multiple layers of different plastics is challenging to recycle using traditional methods. \"By innovating in packaging design and recycling technologies, we can make it possible to recycle a broader range of products efficiently. At Huhtamaki, we are for instance developing flexible monomaterial packaging, removing multiple layers and aluminum to facilitate recycling,\" said Salla Ahonen. Ali Harlin envisioned a near future where advanced technology will facilitate the proper sorting of materials, such as plastic packaging, and improve the quality of recycled materials. \"Before we can achieve automated sorting, we need extensive innovation, start-ups, and investments to drive progress. A chain isn't complete until all its links are in place, and that's why we must patiently build the system from every angle.\"",

        "text": "Press release 29 November 2013, 14:00 EET PRESS RELEASE 29.11.2013 PRESS RELEASE 29.11.2013 Fortum's new bio-oil plant has been commissioned in Joensuu, Finland. Producing bio-oil from wood-based raw materials, the plant is the first of its kind in the world on an industrial scale. The bio-oil plant is unique in that it has been integrated with Fortum's Joensuu combined heat and power plant. Bio-oil is produced from forest residues, wood from first thinnings and other wood biomass, such as forest industry by-products, sourced locally from the Joensuu region. The bio-oil production will increase Fortum's wood use in energy production in Joensuu from 300,000 to 450, 000 solid cubic meter per year. The Joensuu bio-oil plant's annual production of 50,000 tonnes corresponds to the heating needs of more than 10,000 households. The employment impact of the bio-oil production plant project has been estimated to be about 60–70 man-years in the Joensuu region. Jobs are created in raw material sourcing, at the production plant and in logistics. Finnish Parliament Member and Chair of the Commerce Committee Mauri Pekkarinen and Fortum's Chief Financial Officer Markus Rauramo inaugurated the bio-oil plant in Joensuu on Friday, 29 November. \"I am very pleased that our long planned pyrolysis project has now reached this stage. The use of bio-oil has significant positive environmental impacts because energy produced with bio-oil reduces carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 90% or more compared to fossil fuels. We aim for continuous development and growth of the business in CO2-free energy production. Consequently, this investment aligns very well with our strategy,\" CFO Markus Rauramo noted in his inaugural speech. Fortum Otso® bio-oil can be used at heat plants or in industrial steam production as a replacement for heavy and light fuel oil. In the future, bio-oil can be used as a raw material for various biochemicals or traffic fuels. In October, Fortum signed its first agreement to supply bio-oil produced in Joensuu to Savon Voima, which will use the bio-oil to replace the use of heavy and light fuel oil in its district heat production in Iisalmi. Additionally, Fortum will use bio-oil in its own heat plants in Joensuu and in Vermo, Espoo. Joensuu's bio-oil plant is based on so-called fast pyrolysis technology in which wood biomass is rapidly heated in oxygen-free conditions. As a result of the heating, the biomass decomposes and forms gases that are then condensed into oil. Fortum has invested about 30 million euros in its bio-oil plant and in modification work to its heat plants, and the project has received about 8 million euros in government investment subsidies. Development and conceptualisation of the new technology has been done collaboratively between Fortum, Metso, UPM and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The research has been part of TEKES – the Finnish Funding Agency for Tech-nology and Innovation's Biorefine programme.

My main task during my summer job at Fortum was to develop a generic simulation model of a Geothermal Power Plant. Developing geothermal operation and maintenance (O&M) capabilities aligns well with the Fortum eNext strategy on decarbonisation. Training simulators can be extremely beneficial in countries and projects where the new technology training for operators and engineers must be conducted on-site. My main task during my summer job at Fortum was to develop a generic simulation model of a Geothermal Power Plant. Developing geothermal operation and maintenance (O&M) capabilities aligns well with the Fortum eNext strategy on decarbonisation. My main task during my summer job at Fortum was to develop a generic simulation model of a Geothermal Power Plant with an Apros simulation software. The Apros software was developed by Fortum and VTT (Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd). It is used to realistically simulate the dynamic behaviour of thermal power plants and their control systems. The work was a real learning process, as I had no prior experience with Apros software, and this geothermal technology had not been previously modelled with Apros. The primary goal of my work was to prove that geothermal power can be modelled with Apros. My secondary goal was to create a generic model that can be used as a base for commercial applications – like operator training simulators and engineering simulators. Training simulators can be extremely beneficial in countries and projects where the new technology training for operators and engineers must be conducted on-site. The simulators can also be used for engineering applications to reduce downtime and increase availability, e.g. by studying plant behaviour in plant disturbances. Making this basic Apros model of a geothermal power plant is a prelude to developing a training simulator for a mobilisation phase. Developing geothermal operation and maintenance (O&M) capabilities aligns well with the Fortum eNext strategy on decarbonisation. Geothermal power is a local, low-carbon energy source. It does not use fossil fuels. It is profitable to build near regions with volcanic activity. A geothermal power plant is built by drilling holes in prospective regions with underground reservoirs of fluid. The fluid is a mixture of hot water, steam and impurities. The composition is heavily dependent on location. The geofluid is under high pressure. For the modelling I used open source data from geothermal power, generic engineering information on water/steam cycles and some more specific details from an Icelandic geothermal expertise and services company Deilir Technical Services. The current model has three wells, two steam separators, a turbine, a condenser and a cooling tower. Figure 1 shows the operation display of the Apros model. A geothermal power plant does not have fuel. The heat from the earth warms the fluid, which is then put into a water/steam cycle. This is seen below in Figure 1. The steam and water mixture is flashed and separated into steam and brine, as shown in Figure 1. The steam goes to the turbine and the brine to reinjection. In some cases, the brine is flashed more than once to maximise the benefit from it. The brine and condensed steam is reinjected or released above ground. A geofluid reservoir that has been tapped into will gradually decrease in pressure and temperature. When brine is reinjected relatively close to the reservoir, it is replenished. This will slow down the decrease in pressure and fluid production. Geofluid is also full of impurities. These impurities often include hydrogen sulphide, silica, chloride and sodium. The quality of the geofluid is dependent on the location. Without reinjection, these impurities are released above ground and into the atmosphere. The current state of the model is such that it can be used to study changes in production well parameters (incoming steam pressure and temperature), component malfunctions (e.g. stuck valve), leakages in steam pipes and steam turbine degradation (e.g. due to corrosion from impurities). Development opportunities include the addition of impurity calculations, more accurate automation and wider simulation scenarios. The final target is to develop a training simulator for an actual geothermal power plant. In conclusion, it has been an educational and interesting summer. Despite some challenges, like Covid-19 and the consequential remote working, I learned to use the Apros simulation software. My colleagues have been a tremendous help, and I am still learning new things about it. Despite having little data to go on, creating a geothermal model has been successful. Developing a more specific model for a real geothermal power plant is now feasible. The foundation is",

        "text": "A consortium including technology group Wärtsilä has secured European Union funding to develop solutions minimising methane slip from marine engines, advancing the environmental and climate benefits of LNG as a ship fuel. Coordinated by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, the Green Ray project brings together several companies from across the shipping value chain: shipyard Chantiers de l'Atlantique, ship owner CMA CGM, classification society DNV GL, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, ship manager MSC Cruises Management, non-profit organisation Revolve Water and energy major Shell. The project will develop on-engine technologies for low-pressure dual-fuel engines – both 2- and 4-stroke – as well as a novel aftertreatment concept. These solutions will be advanced to a high state of technology readiness, including demonstrators installed on two newbuilds and one retrofitted to an existing vessel. All the technologies developed in Green Ray will also be fully capable to utilize bio- or synthetic methane instead of fossil LNG. Wärtsilä will develop technology specifically for low pressure 4-stroke dual fuel engines that enables methane slip reduction, increases efficiency and lower operational costs at all engine loads. This technology targets the largest four-stroke engines on the market as widely used by cruise ships, ferries and gas carriers. Wärtsilä will also develop an on-engine technology for 2-stroke engines around a patented LNG injection system to reduce methane slip from tankers, container ships, etc. Both technologies will be demonstrated at sea in real application during the project in collaboration with the Green Ray partners. The use of LNG as a marine fuel is accelerating, driven by a well-developed supply infrastructure, a clear transition to cleaner fuels and significant air pollution and climate benefits. The issue of methane slip – unutilized and thus unburned fuel escaping into the atmosphere from engines and across the production and supply chain – is seen as one of the main challenges to wider uptake. \"Methane slip has become an important factor in ship owners' decisions about whether to use LNG fuel,\" said Kati Lehtoranta, Principal Scientist, VTT. \" With these promising technologies we aim to reduce the slip contributing directly to reduction of the total greenhouse gas emissions, opening this pathway to even wider segment of the maritime market.\" Shell has developed a proprietary methane abatement catalyst system that has been lab tested and scaled up to a field demonstration, where it was proven to be effective not only in significantly reducing methane slip (over 90%), but also in handling typical compounds that can degrade the catalyst, via the inclusion of a guard bed. \"Shell's climate ambition to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 will require us to explore a range of avenues that have the potential to help us, our partners, and customers to decarbonise the existing LNG value chain. We are continuously working to improve the value proposition of LNG through dedicated technology research, and we are keen to develop potential solutions to minimise methane slip at such a relevant project as Green Ray,\" explains Alexander Boekhorst, VP Gas Processing and Conversion Technology at Shell. \"This research will allow us to build on the continuous improvements made in reducing methane slip from engines over the past twenty years,\" said Sebastiaan Bleuanus, General Manager, Research Coordination & Funding, Wärtsilä Marine Power. \"Taking these solutions for newbuilds and retrofits to near commercial readiness will be an important step for the long-term viability of LNG as a marine fuel.\" The project has received funding of around €7 million from Horizon Europe. It will run until 2027.

        "text": "Jun 9, 2023 Valmet launched an ambitious R&D program and ecosystem called Beyond Circularity in 2022. It targets the transformation of waste and emissions into valuable resources for sustainable growth and to accelerate the green transition. The program is implemented through seven streams, of which Recycling technologies is one. \"A sustainable future requires a circular economy approach. The fundamental idea of circularity is embedded in Valmet's mission: 'Converting renewable resources into sustainable results.' Recycling is an integral part of the circular economy. At Valmet, we have a long history of developing innovative recycling technologies, so it was natural to include it in our Beyond Circularity program,\" says Henrik Wallmo, who leads the Recycling technologies stream at Valmet. \"In the Recycling technologies stream, we focus on developing recycling technologies across several areas. We're actively working with textile, plastics and panelboard recycling, to mention some examples. We have excellent partners and inspiring and promising topics, so I'm looking forward to many exciting new solutions which will support our customers in their green transition,\" Henrik Wallmo says. Recycling is also close to Henrik's heart in his personal life. \"In my household, we always try to recycle used packaging and sort waste as much as possible. We also try to use things a second or third time. It might be simple things like an old chair becoming a bedside table. I like the idea of seeing waste or leftover materials as an asset and something you can turn into a more valuable new product.\" That's an essential part of Beyond Circularity – taking circularity to the next level, going past traditional recycling to go Beyond. Henrik Wallmo presented Recycling stream in the Beyond Circularity launch event in November 2022. Textiles are an essential part of our everyday life and of many industries. The downside is that the production chain creates ecological challenges, and most textile products end up as waste. Only one percent of all used clothes in the EU is recycled into new clothing, so the recycling level needs to be increased. Consumers are demanding more sustainable and ethical textiles. Technologies already exist that we can utilize – and new ones are underway. The development just needs to be accelerated, and that's what we're driving for with our ecosystem partners. In the fiber-to-fiber textile recycling area, Valmet has delivered the main process equipment for Renewcell's textile recycling plant on the Ortviken industrial site in Sweden. Renewcell produces 60,000 t/a of circulose from pre- and post-consumer polycotton textile waste to be used in viscose or Lyocell production. Read more: Recycled and Cellulose Based Textile Fibers The Sustafit project is an ongoing co-research project which will outline segment-specific sustainability strategies for the use of sustainable and recycled fibers and their processing into non-woven products. The project builds an understanding of jointly identified knowledge gaps and sustainable fiber attractiveness for non-woven applications by developing their hydrophobicity and boosting their antimicrobial performance. Read more about the project. The plastic waste recycling rate is much too low, so we need industrially feasible chemical recycling processes which can utilize mixed plastic waste. Valmet participates in the UrbanMill co-innovation project which is a two-year project, funded by Business Finland and coordinated by Finland's VTT Technical Research Centre in cooperation with Aalto University. It is developing enabling technologies to utilize highly mixed plastic waste as feedstock for chemical recycling, producing high-quality plastic materials that complement the current recycled plastics. It focuses on creating novel concepts by combining tailored pre- and post-treatment technologies with pyrolysis. The project is currently in the piloting phase. The HiPer project is another co-innovation project in this stream. This two-year project is coordinated by VTT, and nine Finnish companies are working together to take the production of new biocomposites to an industrial scale. The aim of the HiPer project is to generate a completely new product portfolio based on lightweight sustainable composite materials. These new materials will be suitable for several industrial sectors such as construction, automotive, transportation, furniture and packaging. Read more on the project's web page. Circular and sustainable flooring and minimizing environmental impact are trending in the panelboard industry. Currently, used Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) materials are mostly burnt, which is unsustainable. So innovative recycling processes are needed. In this field, Valmet has performed pilot trials with customers and carried out its own R&D trials to increase knowledge",

In this project, Valmet collaborated with nine other Finnish companies and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland to study the use of biocomposites on an industrial scale. Photo: VTT, Niina Hyry, 2023 Biocomposites can play a crucial role in transitioning to lighter materials, reducing the use of fossil-based raw materials, and improving recycling efficiency to reduce industrial emissions. The two-year ecosystem project was co-funded by Business Finland, and it was a part of its two Veturi-programs: Valmet's Beyond Circularity and Fortum's and Metsä's ExpandFiber. The project's aim was to generate a completely new product portfolio based on lightweight sustainable composite materials suitable for several industrial sectors such as construction, automotive, transportation, furniture, and packaging. It was extremely inspiring to work on the HiPer project. Cooperation in the project team was innovative, and all project parties were extremely committed to developing futuristic innovations. The ecosystem network covered the entire production chain, from raw-material manufacturing to end users, ensuring a wide perspective, says Mervi Kuoppamäki, Development Manager, R&D, and Valmet's representative in the project. She continues: \"At Valmet, we have strong paper machine and process technology expertise. The HiPer project allowed us to investigate new products with partners which could be made with paper machines. Even though the ecosystem project is now completed, we're continuing work at Valmet. The project provides us a solid foundation for more detailed machine concept design.\" During the project, the HiPer project team focused comprehensively on development work. \"We successfully demonstrated the manufacturing of thermoplastic composites on a pilot paper machine. We used foam forming technology, originally developed for the paper industry, to produce pulp-based biocomposites. This novel technology enables high production volumes, energy-efficient production, and increased flexibility with new raw materials. VTT's expertise and experience in foam technology and long fibers were a crucial factor in securing the successful piloting,\" Kuoppamäki says. In general, HiPer-materials can be processed with normal woodworking tools, function in conventional converting processes. This opens a world of possibilities for various end uses, from furniture to automotive parts, without compromising on the performance or aesthetics. The project presented two new HiPer material demos to showcase the versatility and potential of HiPer biocomposite materials.

        "text": "Jun 19, 2024 I had the pleasure of participating in the \"High Performance Cellulose-based Composites\" (HiPer) project, which was also a part of Valmet's Beyond Circularity R&D program and ecosystem. In this project, Valmet collaborated with nine other Finnish companies and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland to study the industrial-scale use of biocomposites. Our aim was to generate a completely new product portfolio based on lightweight sustainable composite materials suitable for several industrial sectors such as construction, automotive, transportation, furniture, and packaging. You can read more about the project here. These two years were an absolute pleasure and a great source of inspiration for me. While I've spent many years in research and development, this was my first dive into an ecosystem project with a diverse external partner network. It provided a unique opportunity to collaborate, innovate, and network, showing that one plus one is definitely more than two. In general, I find research and development work incredibly inspiring because it always keeps you on the cutting edge of new discoveries. It's rewarding to work with enthusiastic and open-minded people who share common goals and strive to create innovations. And this was also very much the case in the HiPer project. Our collaboration was energizing, and everyone contributed actively. Sustainability and the future of our planet are close to my heart, so it was fruitful to participate in this project to develop alternatives to plastics. The development of plastic-free products and the need to decrease CO2 emissions inspired me to rejoin Valmet a couple of years ago after exploring other challenges outside the company. I am thankful for this opportunity, and I feel this is an opportunity for new business. Our project team had representatives from the entire value chain, which was very educational and eye-opening for me as a representative of an equipment provider. Partners' insights were invaluable, covering aspects like suitable chemicals and end-product requirements. We had regular meetings, which I think was the key to success. Steering meetings allowed us to discuss and decide on high-level topics, while industrial tutorial sessions involved a larger participant group from each company. VTT's suggestion that each participant should host a meeting was great. For example, it allowed me to witness the production of Isku's chairs – a glimpse into the practical application of our work. We conducted pilot runs at VTT in Jyväskylä – conveniently close to my location. Being present during these runs allowed me to influence the study and address challenges specific to paper machines. The results were fascinating and immensely helpful for our internal HiPer project at Valmet. In the HiPer project, we truly pushed boundaries and managed to develop and produce high-performance cellulose-based composites to replace plastic-based materials. I was impressed that we were able to achieve tangible outcomes, as two years is quite a short timeframe in R&D work in general: Photo: VTT, Niina Hyry, 2023 You can read more about these products on HiPer project's home page. As an ecosystem project, HiPer was completed in April 2024. However, this is only a good start. At Valmet, we are continuing our internal R&D project to study how we can modify our processes to better fit the production of cellulose-based composites. My tips for anyone embarking on an ecosystem innovation project: Be active, participate actively, listen attentively and think beyond conventional boundaries.

        "text": "HUHTAMÄKI OYJ PRESS RELEASE 12.10.2020 AT 10:00 Huhtamaki donation helps clean plastics from the Mithi River in Mumbai, India Global sustainable food packaging leader Huhtamaki is donating €600,000 to fund a project that aims to stop the flow of plastic into the Indian Ocean from the Mithi River in Mumbai, India. The project is one of three initiatives that Huhtamaki has funded as part of its 100-year anniversary to address global sustainability challenges and build and learn from circular economy initiatives globally. The Mithi River project is run by a global partnership between the United Nations Technology Innovation Labs UNTIL, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, RiverRecycle and Earth5R. Each partner has a unique role in the project which seeks to use emerging technologies to collect plastic waste from the river and raises awareness on effective waste management in order to drive systemic change locally. The project is also focused on developing ways to valorize waste, e.g. by turning it into valuable fuels, chemicals, bio energy and bio fertilizers. More specifically, Earth5R, an India-based citizen-led environmental movement, is organizing local hands-on workshops with key stakeholders on effective waste management and recycling with a view to drive systemic change. RiverRecycle, a Finnish cleantech start-up, provides the technology to collect the plastic and floating debris from the river for recycling, thus stopping it from entering the Indian Ocean. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland will collect and analyze data on the floating waste and its seasonal variations in order to optimize the river's clean-up operations and recycling process development for the future. It will share this information to support future circular economy studies and initiatives. The United Nations Technology Innovation Labs UNTIL manages the project and provides expertise both in India as well as on valorizing the collected waste via sorting and recycling. \"The partnership organizations are delighted to be working with the Huhtamaki team and look forward to delivering this groundbreaking initiative over the coming 18 months,\" says Professor Joseph Adelegan, Circular Economy Lead for the United Nations Technology Innovation Labs. \"The collected data will also support future circular economy studies and can serve as a starting point for possible future clean-up actions with optimal resource use,\" he continues.

        "text": "Quantum-computing provider IQM aims to be Europe's leader in the field. The company's strength lies in raw R&D brain power, leading-edge technology, and a growing patent portfolio that Papula-Nevinpat is helping to protect. The computer this article was written upon runs on strings of binary digits (or bits): the integers 0 and 1 arranged in varying ways to form units of information. Bits are always either zero or one – they cannot be both at the same time. It's this fundamental principle of information science that quantum computers have changed. The basic unit of information in quantum computing is called a qubit, which can be both one and zero at the same time. Through the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement, quantum computers constantly change the state of qubits in order to perform certain calculations and simulations in a much more efficient way than ordinary computers can. \"A quantum computer is a powerful simulating machine,\" says Dr. Inés de Vega, IQM's Head of Intellectual Property development. \"It's able to simulate and optimise many different types of processes, including drug development, carbon capture, traffic optimisation or financial instrument pricing.\" Like many quantum-computing companies, IQM has its roots in academia and government-funded research. Several of the company's founders and a number of its employees have been part of the quantum-computing research group at Finland's Aalto University. Today, IQM has 60 of the brightest minds in the field working out of offices in Helsinki and Munich. \"There are relatively few people in the world with quantum-computing skills, but we have been able to recruit a really top team,\" says IQM's Chief Operating Officer and Co-Founder, Dr. Juha Vartiainen. \"Our aim is to build a pan-European quantum-tech company and extend partnerships with universities and research teams all over Europe. Our initial customers are governments and national research organisations, so there is lots of technical and business complexity involved.\" As quantum computers can become extremely powerful, a lot of the technology around them has traditionally been controlled by governments. In the United States, some quantum-computing companies face restrictions on exporting the actual quantum hardware and can only offer the technology as a cloud service. It's not infeasible to think of a quantum computer breaking encryption codes, for example, which would severely affect internet traffic and could disrupt many of the smart technologies that are increasingly part of our lives. Hence, the industry has a history of tight cooperation between the public and private sectors. \"At IQM, we have accumulated more than a decade of patented R&D from Aalto University and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. These technologies will enable us to reach quantum advantage sooner,\" says Dr. Kuan Yen Tan, IQM's Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder. \"This emphasizes the importance of R&D and IPR protection as the currency of this deep-tech industry.\" One of the ways IQM sets itself apart from other quantum-computer makers is by developing application-specific processors for different use cases and industries. In the field of chemistry, for example, this means being able to simulate specific phenomena that help with drug discovery, or that can aid the development of new types of materials and the processes by which they're made. The field of pathfinding – critical for self-driving vehicles – is also emerging as an important area. Quantum computing can be applied to finance too, helping with portfolio optimisation and scenario prediction. \"The most straightforward applications of quantum-computing concern the simulation of systems and the resolution of problems grounded in clear quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as finding the equilibrium state of a molecule,\" says de Vega. \"But today we know that quantum computers are very good at simulating classical systems and processes too.\" \"Take the Black-Scholes financial model, for example. Although the process it describes is not intrinsically quantum mechanical, the simulation of the equation may be much more efficient with a quantum computer than with a traditional computer,\" she says. \"Another example is modelling the perfect network for solar cells, both optimising sunlight and taking into consideration that you need to transport and store the energy. This is an optimisation scenario where there are no quantum-mechanical effects involved, but it may be very efficiently described with quantum computers.\" Quantum computer from inside. Photo: IQM The computers themselves are highly sensitive and need to be operated under tightly-controlled conditions. If not well shielded, interference can be introduced by people in the room, furniture being moved, or even a train rumbling deep underground.

Uutinen6.11.2020 Nykyaikana niin yritykset kuin julkiset toimijatkin ovat havainneet innovaatioiden tuottamisen ja hyödyntämisen tärkeäksi. Valtio ja yksityiset yritykset ovat jo vuosia Suomessa selkeästi päättäneet panostaa innovaatioihin ja niiden tuottamiseen valtiovarainministeriön, työ- ja elinkeinoministeriön sekä opetus- ja kulttuuriministeriön kautta. Sen sijaan avoimet innovaatio ja innovaatioekosysteemit ovat vielä kehittymässä vakiintuneiksi toimintatavoiksi. Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT aloitti vasta vuonna 2018 innovaatioekosysteemien systemaattisen kehittämisen. Työ- ja elinkeinoministeriön tutkimus- ja innovaationeuvoston tavoitteena on, että Suomi on osaavin ja vetovoimaisin innovaatioympäristö vuonna 2030. Tähän tavoitteeseen pyritään luomalla ekosysteemejä tukemaan aloja, joilla työ- ja elinkeinoministeriö määrittelee Suomessa olevan vahvaa osaamista. Tulevaisuuden innovatiivisten digitaalisten palveluiden-YAMK-koulutuksen opiskelija Laura Puusaaren opinnäytteen tarkoituksena on tuottaa uutta tietoa innovaatioekosysteemien toiminnasta ja rakenteista sekä radikaalien innovaatioiden kehittämisestä. Tarkoitus pohjautuu vahvasti siihen, että innovaatioekosysteemit ovat verrattain uusia ja niitä perustetaan ratkomaan tulevaisuuden haasteita. Innovaatioekosysteemien rakenteista ja radikaalien innovaatioiden kehittämisestä innovaatioekosysteemeissä on kuitenkin vain vähän mallinnettua käytännön tietoa. Opinnäytteen päätuotos on Innovaatioekosysteemien käsikirja, joka sisältää kuvauksen toimivan innovaatioekosysteemin rakenteesta, innovaatioekosysteemien perustajan tarkistuslistan sekä kuvauksen radikaalien innovaatioiden vaatimista erityispiirteistä. Innovaatioekosysteemien rakenne on kuvattu roolien ja toimijoiden näkökulmasta, siinä kuvataan keskeiset roolit sekä rakenne toimijoiden suhteesta toisiinsa sekä omiin verkostoihinsa. Innovaatioekosysteemien perustajan tarkistuslistassa on tärkeimmät asiat, jotka on varmistettava, kuvattava ja sovittava innovaatioekosysteemejä perustettaessa. Tarkistuslista toimii myös olemassa olevien innovaatioekosysteemien perusasioiden varmistamiseen. Kehittämistyön pohjalta löytyi myös selkeitä piirteitä, jotka koskevat radikaalien innovaatioiden kehittämistä. Myös nämä piirteet on esitetty käsikirjassa ja selitetty tarkemmin opinnäytteessä. Näitä tuotoksia on mahdollista soveltaa sekä olemassa oleviin että perusteilla oleviin innovaatioekosysteemeihin sekä radikaalien innovaatioiden kehittämiseen. Kuitenkaan tuotoksien ei nähdä soveltuvan ainoastaan toimeksiantajan käyttöön tai vain innovaatioekosysteemeihin. Tuotoksia voi hyödyntää kuka tahansa innovaatioekosysteemeihin osallistuva, niitä perustava tai osallistumista harkitseva taho. Tuotoksia voi myös suurilta osin hyödyntää muiden ekosysteemien, kuten liiketoimintaekosysteemien tai teknologiaekosysteemien kehittämisessä. Näin ollen tuotokset ovat laajennettavissa perusperiaatteiltaan myös opinnäytteen keskeisen kontekstin ulkopuolelle. Opinnäytetyö toteutettiin osana Opetus-ja kulttuuriministeriön sekä Laurea-ammattikorkeakoulun Co-Creation Orchestration -hanketta. Opinnäytteen tuotos on myös pohja, jota jatkokehittämällä Laurea voidaan nähdä rakentamassa tulevaisuuden ratkaisuja ekosysteemeissä. Opinnäytteen tutkimusstrategiana oli innovaatiotutkimus, jonka tarkoituksena oli tuottaa uutta tietoa työelämän käytännöistä. Tässä opinnäytteessä työelämän käytännöt olivat toiminen innovaatioekosysteemeissä sekä radikaalien innovaatioiden kehittäminen niissä. Aineiston muodosti seitsemän teemahaastattelua, ja kaikki haastateltavat olivat innovaatioekosysteemitoiminnan ammattilaisia. Kerätty aineisto analysoitiin aineistolähtöisen sisällönanalyysin kautta.

Helen is involved in an EU project to test new solutions in climate change mitigation in cities. Energy saving plays a key role in the project. On a global scale, cities produce 70% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Helsinki is taking major steps together with the local residents and businesses in order to make Helsinki a climate-neutral city. This target is supported by the mySMARTLife project which, for example, tests emission-free electric robot buses and encourages housing companies in the Merihaka district towards energy efficiency in building renovation. The mySMARTLife project is part of the EU's Horizon 2020 programme to test new solutions for climate change mitigation in cities. Experiments in the project achieve an energy saving of 10–20% and expedite market access of the best solutions. The solutions tested in Helsinki can be utilised in other cities in Finland and elsewhere in the world. Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences will be testing a robot bus as from summer 2017. The smart minibus uses its sensors to perceive its environment and take other road users into account. During the long-term experiment, new technologies will be studied in order to reduce the emissions and costs of public transport while examining passengers' attitudes towards driverless transport. A similar experiment in the SOHJOA project in the Hervanta district of Tampere last autumn was a success. The purpose of automated buses is to offer an effortless and safe transport for all, not forgetting persons with reduced mobility and parents with prams,' says Project Director Harri Santamala of the Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The final route and timetables of the robot bus will be published before summer. Intelligent control of heat consumption that adapts to the user's individual needs at different times of the day and night is being tested in Merihaka together with the local residents. Intelligent heat control also enables studying of demand response. Demand response will be used for balancing consumption peaks in the future, i.e. there will be no need to use the most expensive and most polluting heating plants during the cold weather spells. During the project, the residents of Merihaka will also be offered advice on energy saving. Owned by the City of Helsinki and used by the University of Helsinki, the Environment House in Viikki will be made even more energy efficient by installing remote heating controls in the property. With the controls, the building is heated according to need with the aid of machine intelligence and the human thermal model developed by VTT. The property also takes part in demand response for heat and electricity. Moreover, methods to increase renewable energy production and reduce annual consumption even down to the zero level are also investigated. The needs of the property and the electricity network are optimised with a smart electricity storage system. Full advantage is taken of the large solar power plant and wells drilled into the rock for the benefit of the property. Korkeasaari Zoo aims to be carbon neutral by year 2025. Transition to renewable energy, reducing energy consumption and promotion of low-emission transport modes are a prerequisite for achieving the target. The potential of Smart Kalasatama in electricity demand response is being studied at Kalasatama. In the district of Suvilahti next to Kalasatama, technological expertise is being reinforced by combining electricity storage, solar energy production and charging of electric vehicles. The project is implemented by the City of Helsinki, Helen Ltd, Forum Virium Helsinki Oy, the Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, as well as the SMEs Fourdeg Oy and Salusfin Oy. The European Commission has granted EUR 18 million as funding for the joint venture to be implemented in 2017–2022. The budget for measures in Helsinki is EUR 5.6 million. The cities of Hamburg and Nantes are also involved in the project. The project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme in accordance with grant agreement No. 731297.",

Se sijoittui kansallisessa vertailussa jaetulle ykkössijalle ja sai kiitosta valtakunnallisesta tavoittavuudesta sekä vahvoista yhteyksistään niin Suomessa kuin kansainvälisesti. \"Seinäjoen ammattikorkeakoulu on kehittänyt usean vuoden ajan alueellista digitaalista innovaatiohubia (DIH) yhteistyössä alueen pk-yritysten kanssa nimeltä IoT Compass Hub. Meille on hyvin luonnollista, että olemme mukana hakemassa uutta eurooppalaista digitaalista innovaatiohubia. SIX Manufacturing EDIH:illä on realisoituessaan erinomaiset mahdollisuudet vauhdittaa Suomessa toimivien valmistavan pk-teollisuuden yritysten digitaalista transformaatiota. Tästä on merkittävä hyöty liiketoiminnallisesti Etelä-Pohjanmaan alueen yrityksille. Tällöin myös koko Etelä-Pohjanmaan alue hyötyy. Me tuomme oman vahvan osaamisemme EDIH-konsortion hyödynnettäväksi, josta hyötyy koko digitaalisen valmistuksen ekosysteemi Suomessa ja Euroopassa.\", tutkimus- ja kehittämispäällikkö Ari Sivula Seinäjoen ammattikorkeakoulusta kertoo. SeAMK tuo SIX Manufacturing EDIH-konsortioon monenlaista osaamista digitaalisen valmistuksen ja teollisen internetin saralta sisältäen mm. robotiikan, digitaalisten kaksosten, simulointien, XR-teknologioiden, tekoälyn, IoT:n sekä konenäön osaamisen. Teknologisen osaamisen lisäksi SeAMK tuo liiketoimintaan liittyvää osaamista EDIH-konsortion hyödynnettäväksi. Taustalla on pitkäjänteinen kehittämistyö digitaalisen valmistuksen ja teollisen internetin saralla Seinäjoen ammattikorkeakoulussa. Muut Suomen ehdokkaat eurooppalaisiksi digitaalisiksi innovaatiohubeiksi ovat: Eurooppalaiset digitaaliset innovaatiohubit (European Digital Innovation Hubs, EDIH) eli digitaali-innovaatiokeskittymät ovat osa EU:n uutta Digitaalinen Eurooppa -ohjelmaa. Ne toimivat digi-investointeja sekä erityisesti pk-yritysten digitalisaatiota vauhdittavina palvelukeskuksina. Hubien toiminnan on oltava voittoa tavoittelematonta. – Valituissa eri toimijoiden yhteistyöhankkeissa tehdään työtä sen eteen, että digitalisaatiosta saadaan irti nykyistä enemmän kestävää kasvua. Eurooppalainen verkosto tukee parempien digitalisaatiopalveluiden kehittämistä, ja suomalaisilla on tähän työhön paljon annettavaa. Monipuolinen ja kyvykäs ehdokasjoukko takaa, että Suomesta voidaan eri tilanteissa valita riittävästi maantieteellisesti, teknologisesti ja sovellusalueiltaan sopivia ja laadukkaita hubeja osaksi EU:n laajuista verkostoa, toteaa elinkeinoministeri Mika Lintilä. Jäsenvaltioiden tulee valita ehdokkaansa innovaatiohubeiksi avoimella menettelyllä. Työ- ja elinkeinoministeriö järjesti 18.11.2020–15.1.2021 avoimen haun, johon tuli kymmenen hakemusta. Ehdokkaat arvioi riippumaton kahdeksanhenkinen arviointiraati, jonka jäsenillä on monipuolista osaamista elinkeinoelämän uudistumisesta, digitalisaatiosta, innovaatiotoiminnasta ja tieteestä. Hakemukset asetettiin järjestykseen raadin pisteytysten perusteella, minkä jälkeen ministeriö päätti jatkoon menevien ehdokkaiden lukumäärän. Nyt valitut ehdokkaat pääsevät osallistumaan rajattuun eurooppalaiseen hakuun, jossa Euroopan komissio valitsee digitaaliset innovaatiohubit. Ehdokkailla on mahdollisuus kehittää edelleen hakemuksiaan ja tarvitsemaansa yhteistyötä. Tämän hetkisten tietojen mukaan EU-haku avataan maaliskuussa, se on avoinna vähintään kymmenen viikkoa, ja tulokset ovat selvillä viimeisellä vuosineljänneksellä. Suomen hubien lukumäärä on enintään neljä. EU:n kattavan, jopa noin 200 hubin verkoston luomiseksi EU-rahoitus on jaoteltu jäsenvaltioittain. Digitaalinen Eurooppa -ohjelmasta on suunniteltu varattavan noin 14,8 miljoonaa euroa Suomen hubien rahoitukseen vuosina 2021–2027. Työ- ja elink",

        "text": "Services Global links Many people are now wondering whether it is safe to return to the office. In Workery+, both information and health security have been taken to a higher level. \"The safety and health of the premises must be guaranteed so that companies and their employees can return to the office. YIT's Workery+ business premisesconcept largely started out from developing safety,\"says EVP Anders Stenbäck from YIT's service development unit. In the Workery+ concept, companies contract workspaces for the desired number of employees and pay for the space according to use. They can rent private facilities, open-plan workstations or an optimal combination of the two with a flexible agreement. Stenbäck points out that when both private offices and shared spaces are available, the importance of information and other security is particularly important. Employees at Workery+ have a mobile application that works as a membership card and access pass, among others. It is also used to book workstations and conference rooms on the shared premises. \"Checking in is essential as it helps maintain a high level of safety and ensures that unauthorised individuals cannot access the premises,\" Stenbäck says. Businesses can securely store confidential information in the lockable offices they have rented for their own use without having to worry about unauthorised access. In addition to the offices, spaces such as conference rooms have been soundproofed and the glass walls of the conference rooms have been covered with taping to protect them from the eyes of outsiders. Cybersecurity, including Wi-Fi connections, has been authorised. An external investigator assesses the situation regularly. \"Our partner Netox monitors that things are organised on site so that information cannot leak from one company to another. Wireless connections, for example, are end-to-end encrypted, and you can only obtain your own papers from the printer with your application.\" The premises also make use of innovative real estate technology applications. The shared KEKO ecosystem of YIT, KONE, Nokia, Caverion, Halton and Netoxin aims to improve the comfort, productivity and eco-friendliness of real estate by adapting the data from all of the technical systems onto a shared platform. In fact, the intelligent real estate technology used in the Workery+ concept made it a winner of the international Smart Building Global Award. \"Our goal is to combine an excellent service concept and new technology for a world-class customer experience,\" Stenbäck emphasises. However, Workery+ security solutions are not confined to technology only. In spatial planning, safety and health concerns have been taken into account with adequate space, ergonomic furniture and hand sanitation points, among other things. Every Workery+ member can use an adjustable electric desk and select between a saddle stool and a chair with arm and back rests. \"Our office has contactless taps and light switches. In addition, workstation surfaces are antimicrobial. Conference rooms and other places where people sit or spend time are cleaned and disinfected regularly,\" says Stenbäck. In Workery+, health security even extends to the breathing air. Genano's innovative air purification systems are used in the premises because, according to research conducted by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, they eliminate 99.999 per cent of the bacteria and viruses in indoor air. Workery+ has been awarded for a groundbreaking concept and it has won the \"Smartest Building in the world 2021\" award at the international Real Estate Futureproof event. The first Workery+ opened at Sturenkatu 16, in Vallila, Helsinki,in May 2021. Learn more about Workery+ here. As a result, the Workery + network now already includes four facilities.

        "text": "(UPM, Helsinki, March 11, 2014 at 12.00 EET) Fortum, UPM and Valmet have joined forces to develop a new, winning technology to produce advanced high value lignocellulosic fuels, such as transportation fuels or higher value bio liquids. The idea is to develop catalytic pyrolysis technology for upgrading bio-oil and commercialise the solution. According to several studies pyrolysis technology is seen as the most competitive route to produce advanced lignocellulosic biofuels, and is one of the most efficient routes for meeting EU2020 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. The five-year project is called LignoCat (lignocellulosic fuels by catalytic pyrolysis). The project is a natural continuation of the consortium's earlier bio-oil project together with the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, commercialising integrated pyrolysis technology for production of sustainable bio-oil for replacement of heating oil in industrial use. In this project, the consortium aims higher and the target is to develop novel integrated technology to produce high value biofuels to replace fossil transportation fuels, and thereby create new business for the consortium companies. \"We will develop pyrolysis technology enabling improvement of bio-oil quality compatible for further refining to transportation fuels or intermediate products. This is a business opportunity for us, which will lead to new sustainable processes and products. We see a great potential in this project and look forward to continued cooperation,\" says Jussi Mäntyniemi, Director, Technology and R&D, Valmet. Successful project execution will help utilities and the forest industry sector in making investment decisions for entering advanced biofuel production.UPM's knowledge of biofuels plays a key role in the project. \"Our aim is to become a significant advanced biofuel producer. In accordance with our strategy, we will start production in Lappeenranta with crude tall oil residue as a raw material, and simultaneously we are looking for ways of producing biofuels out of solid wood biomass. Catalytic pyrolysis is one of the promising options we are looking into,\" says Petri Kukkonen, Vice President, UPM Biofuels.New technologies based on integration enable energy efficient production of advanced biofuels and is a way to maximise the value of Nordic biomass. \"Fortum is eager to continue this work towards higher value bio liquids based on the former successful co-operation with our R&D partners. This project is a straight continuation to our first CHP (Combined Heat and Power) -integrated bio oil investment in Joensuu and supports perfectly our strategy to increase total efficiency and value of our fleet of CHPs. The project's scope opens us the possibility to explore interesting new business opportunities and to define our role in the production chain of advanced biofuels\", says Jukka Heiskanen, Head of R&D at Fortum's Heat business.The LignoCat project is funded by Tekes – the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. The outcome, when successful, will be a new sustainable product on the market. It will significantly reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation and heating sectors, and thus help in achieving national and international targets in greenhouse gas emission reduction. The project will create a knowledge cluster within biorefining for universities, research centres and consortium partners.In addition to employment opportunities, final products will have a positive impact on the Finnish and European trade balance as the target market for second generation transportation fuels by 2020 is 10 million tonnes per year.

        "text": "1 Rules for the TURMS -Innovation cluster Lyyli Living Lab and the coordinator of its activities TURMS ( Tampere Urban Rail Mobility Services) – Innovation cluster is an open development environment for city transport and mobility services that utilise trams as their core component and for related digital services. The host organisation for the Turms -Innovation cluster is Tampere Raitiotie Oy (TRO), and Lyyli Living Lab is part of the Testbed Finland network. Lyyli Living Lab is intended to accelerate, in a user -centred manner, the creation of products and services and sustainable urban development through real -life, agile experiments, verifications and reference solutions. Activities also include solving the goal - orientated c hallenges related to the development of the city's transport system. In the core of TURMS -Innovation cluster is the innovation cluster , which has the SmartRail Ecosystem at its c enter and also includes companies, public sector actors, research organisations and service users. Cluster companies are typically service and technology developers , service providers and associated start -ups . Lyyli Living Lab provides application developers with a data transfer connection to the test tram environment and with interfaces for the data sources provided by the test tram and the devices/systems installed there – sources which can be combined with other data from th e urban traffic environment. It is also possible to agree with the tram and equipment suppliers on the utilisation of special data related to the systems. In addition, the physical environments can be used for carrying out experiments that relate to the de pot, stops, charging stations, feeder transport and tram. Living Lab environment , coordinated by VTT, is build -in Lyyli -tramcar to facilitate the development activities . The environment provides experiment authors with a research data platform that utilise s Living Lab data, an application development environment with accompanying tools, a HelpDesk, an experiment register + self-assessment tool and a versatile and easy -to-use user feedback system . The basic principles for using the open Lyyli Living Lab development environment are as follows. 1. The open development environment can be utilised by companies, public actors, research and education organisations, cities, foundations, sectoral organisations, etc. This applies to both domestic and international actors. 2. The registered users who have paid the annual partnership fee together form the TURMS -Innovation cluster. Registration takes place by filling the application form available online www.tampereenratikka.fi . At the same time, a description is given of the content and scheduling of the planned experiment. TRO then processes the application within two weeks and the feedback provided includes, among other things, an approved membership category. 3. Experiments and other measures relating to the internal structure of the tram and the details of the subsystems also require approval from the tram and/or subsystem supplier. 2 4. Experiments will be assessed according to the safety methods of TRO and the tramcar manufacturer Skoda -Transtech. Should the proposed experiment cause a safety risk, which can`t be managed , will it be a reason to deny the experiment . 5. The membership categories that give the right to use the development environment are: Large company, midcap company, small enterprise, microenterprise, star t-up enterprise, university and polytechnic, research institute, foundation / association / sectoral organisation, city or city -owned company, and public sector operator. 6. Coordination of the development environment is based on the one -stop shop principle and is conducted via the host organisation. The host organisation designates the contact person(s) and maintains an up -to-date website in order to facilitate information exchange. Members of the development environment are actively informed about future Lyyli Living Lab events and are offered the opportunity to influence their content. 7. All members have equal rights to reserve and use services in the development environment i n accordance with the host organisation's experiment evaluation and approval process (process description provided below). Depending on the experiment, the process may also include functionality and safety conditions set by the tram supplier and equipment/ system suppliers. 8. The experiment author shall provide its test plan for TRO `s assesment in advance ; the impacts to the tramcar, tramway infrastructure and to the general safety will be assessed prior to the a cceptance of the experiment. TRO may ask changes to the test plan or to deny the expereiment in case it could cause reputational damages or unreasonable harm to the tramcar, tramway infrastructure, tramway operations or to the passengers. 9.

Oma Helen palvelee ympäri vuorokauden Se helpoin tapa hankkia aurinkopaneelit Kirjoita jotakin hakukenttään. Kokeile toista hakutermiä? Helen on mukana EU-hankkeessa, jossa testataan uusia ratkaisuja ilmastonmuutoksen hillitsemiseksi kaupungeissa. Energiansäästöllä on keskeinen rooli. Maailmanlaajuisesti kaupungit tuottavat 70 % kaikista kasvihuonekaasupäästöistä. Helsinki on ottamassa yhdessä kaupunkilaisten ja yritysten kanssa suuria askeleita tehdäkseen kaupungista hiilineutraalin. Tätä tavoitetta tukee mySMARTLife-hanke, jossa muun muassa kokeillaan päästötöntä sähkörobottibussia sekä kannustetaan Merihaan taloyhtiöitä energiatehokkuuteen korjausrakentamisessa. MySMARTLife-hanke on osa EU:n Horisontti 2020 -ohjelmaa, jossa testataan uusia ratkaisuja ilmastonmuutoksen hillitsemiseksi kaupungeissa. Hankkeen kokeiluilla saavutetaan 10–20% energiansäästö ja nopeutetaan parhaiden ratkaisujen pääsyä markkinoille. Helsingissä testattuja ratkaisuja on mahdollista hyödyntää muissa kaupungeissa Suomessa sekä maailmalla. Metropolia ammattikorkeakoulu testaa robottibussia kesästä 2017 alkaen. Älykäs minibussi aistii sensoreilla ympäristöään ja huomioi muut tienkäyttäjät. Pitkäaikaiskokeilun aikana tutkitaan uusia teknologioita, joilla voidaan vähentää joukkoliikenteen päästöjä ja kustannuksia sekä selvitetään matkustajien suhtautumista ilman kuljettajaa tapahtuvaan liikennöintiin. \"Samantyyppinen kokeilu SOHJOA-hankkeessa Tampereen Hervannassa viime syksynä oli menestys. Automaattibussien tarkoituksena on tarjota vaivaton ja turvallinen kyyti kaikille liikuntarajoitteisia tai lastenvaunujen kanssa matkustavia unohtamatta\", kertoo projektijohtaja Harri Santamala Metropolia Ammattikorkeakoulusta. Robottibussin lopullinen reitti ja aikataulut selviävät kesään mennessä. Merihaassa testataan asukkaiden kanssa älykästä lämmönkulutuksen ohjausta, joka on sovitettavissa käyttäjän omiin tarpeisiin vuorokauden eri hetkinä. Älykäs lämmön ohjaus mahdollistaa myös kysyntäjouston tutkimisen. Kysyntäjoustolla tasataan tulevaisuudessa kulutuspiikkejä, jolloin kylmällä ilmalla ei tarvitse käyttää kaikkein kalleimpia ja saastuttavimpia lämmityslaitoksia. Merihaan asukkaille tarjotaan hankkeen ajan myös energiansäästöön liittyvää neuvontaa. Helsingin kaupungin ja yliopiston käytössä olevasta Viikin ympäristötalosta tehdään entistä energiatehokkaampi asentamalla kiinteistöön lämmityksen etäsäätö. Sen avulla rakennusta lämmitetään tarpeen mukaisesti sekä koneälyllä, että VTT:llä kehitetyn lämpöviihtyvyysmallin avulla. Kiinteistö osallistuu myös lämmön ja sähkön kysyntäjoustoon. Lisäksi tutkitaan keinoja lisätä uusiutuvan energian tuotantoa ja vähentää vuosittaista kulutusta jopa nollatasolle. Älykkään sähkövaraston avulla optimoidaan niin kiinteistön kuin sähköverkon tarpeita. Suuresta aurinkovoimalasta ja kallioon poratuista kaivoista otetaan kaikki hyöty irti kiinteistön hyväksi. Korkeasaaren tavoitteena on olla hiilineutraali vuoteen 2025 mennessä. Uusiutuvaan energiaan siirtyminen, energiankulutuksen vähentäminen ja vähäpäästöisten liikkumismuotojen edistäminen ovat edellytyksenä tavoitteeseen pääsyssä. Kalasatamassa tutkitaan Fiksun Kalasataman potentiaalia sähkön kysyntäjoustossa. Kalasataman vieressä Suvilahdessa vahvistetaan teknologista osaamista yhdistämällä sähkön varastointi, aurinkoenergian tuotanto ja sähköisten liikennevälineiden lataus. Hankkeen toteuttavat Helsingin kaupunki, Helen Oy, Forum Virium Helsinki Oy, Metropolia Ammattikorkeakoulu, sekä Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT Oy ja PK-yritykset Fourdeg Oy ja Salusfin Oy. Euroopan komissio on myöntänyt vuosina 2017–2022 toteutettavalle yhteishankkeelle 18M€ rahoituksen. Helsingin toimenpiteiden budjettiosuus on 5,6M€. Hankkeessa ovat mukana myös Hampurin ja Nantesin kaupungit. Hanke on saanut rahoitusta Euroopan Unionin Horisontti 2020 tutkimus- ja innovaatio-ohjelmasta rahoitussopimuksen No 731297 mukaisesti. © Helen Oy 2023",

        "text": "THE SPECTRUM ROUND TABLE Getting to the heart of industry matters Is the industry ready to replace fossil-fuel-based products? SPECTRUM recently brought together industry professionals from leading research organizations, associations, and companies to discuss the opportunities and challenges being presented to pulp and paper producers in the replacement of plastic products with paper and board. Over the following pages are excerpts from the enthusiastic panel discussion that was held at the Confederation of European Paper Industries' (CEPI) headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. What are you and your organizations working on right now when it comes to replacing plastics with fi ber-based products? ELINA PÄÄKKÖNEN: We are working on lots of diff erent proj- ects at VTT when it comes to fi ber replacing plastic, but one of the most exciting ones my particular team is currently work- ing on, is in the development of foam forming to replace EPS (expanded polystyrene foam). Foam-formed, fi ber-based prod- ucts are perfectly able to replace numerous products that are currently made out of polystyrene – for instance, cushioning materials used in various packaging. The beauty of a foam- formed fi ber product is that it contains only fi bers, water, a surfactant, and air, meaning it is at once both renewable and recyclable – unlike polystyrene.FREDERIK ROSÉN: At RISE, we carry out a lot of surveys glob- ally in the area of packaging, and it is clear that consumers the world over are demanding products that are good for the envi- ronment. However, we can't escape the fact that plastic has properties that paper does not have – at least not yet. At RISE, we are doing a lot of research into changing the fundamen- tal properties of paper, for instance, introducing stretchability, much like is seen in the plastic product cling fi lm. One of the partners we are researching with has developed a technology that can be retrofi tted to a paper machine that will allow paper to stretch. The fact is, if the industry wants to take market share from plastic, it must work on much more than just fl at surfaces and cardboard boxes. ESA TORNIAINEN: At Paptic, we are noticing that our custom- ers, particularly in the packaging sector, are keen and ready to replace plastic products with renewable ones. We are busy bringing our novel wood fi ber alternative in packaging to the market and we are getting a very favourable response to how our product looks and feels when compared to plastic, especially when it comes to shopping bags. Brand owners are now tak- ing action, actually faster than what was expected a couple of years ago, and there is an urgent need for sustainable materials that fi t to the existing value chains of packaging. BERNARD DE GALEMBERT: Working for CEPI, I take much more of a \"helicopter view\", as we are not dedicated to prod- ucts or output. It is our aim here at the confederation to cre- ate an environment where the pulp and paper industry is at the core of the bioeconomy and link it directly to the circular economy, encouraging policy makers to enable opportunities for fi ber-based products to blossom.

        "text": "Neste Oil CorporationPress release10 February 2011 at 11 am (EET) Excellent results from biofuel trial involving Neste Oil, Helsinki Region Transport, and Proventia: significantly reduced local emissions A three-year biofuel trial organized by Neste Oil, Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), and Proventia has recently been completed, and the results have confirmed that Neste Oil's NExBTL renewable diesel can significantly reduce local emissions that have a direct impact on urban air quality. Data collected by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland show that particulate emissions were reduced by 30% and NOx emissions by 10%. No problems were encountered with vehicles' tailpipe emissions control systems. VTT estimates that, if all the buses in Greater Helsinki were to use 100% NExBTL renewable diesel, the reduction in traffic-related particulate emissions would be the equivalent of taking a third of the buses in the region off the road. \"The results of the trial show that NExBTL renewable diesel is a good solution for reducing public transport local emissions,\" says Sakari Toivola, Neste Oil's Executive Vice President, Oil Retail. \"Bus fleets do not have to be replaced or upgraded to use the fuel, which is a major financial plus. The fuel also works very well in older buses and performs excellently even in challenging winter conditions.\" NExBTL renewable diesel produced from currently available raw materials offers a more than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil diesel. NExBTL is currently produced from vegetable oil, such as palm oil and rapeseed oil, and waste fat from food manufacturers. In the future, the raw material base is set to be broader, as extensive R&D work is currently under way to develop new raw material sources. 50 million kilometers covered in the world's largest biofuel trialThe trial in Greater Helsinki was the world's largest renewable fuel field trial to date. The partners involved were Helsinki Region Transport, Neste Oil, Proventia, an expert in emission control technologies, VTT, which was responsible for measurement work, and local bus companies. The project was part of the BioRefine research project coordinated by Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. Around 300 vehicles, or over 20% of HSL's buses, took part in the trial, driving more than 50 million kilometers in all. During the initial phase of the trial, buses used a blend of 30% NExBTL renewable diesel and 70% standard diesel fuel. From 2008 onwards, some ran on 100% NExBTL. Those running solely on NExBTL renewable diesel achieved the largest reductions in emissions. In addition to lower particulate and NOx emissions, using NExBTL also results in lower emissions of aromatic PAH hydrocarbons. Use of NExBTL renewable diesel by buses will continueUse of Neste Oil's NExBTL renewable diesel will continue in buses in Greater Helsinki after the conclusion of the Optibio trial. Following the outcome of competitive tenders for routes in Espoo and Vantaa announced on 14 December 2010, the 2011 fall timetable will see 19 buses running on NExBTL. This was the first time that CO2 emissions were used as one of the criteria in HSL's competitive tender process, joining other emissions that have been used previously.

        "text": "Cybersecurity is essential to ensure the functioning of our society in a world where all important infrastructure depends on effective and secure data transfer. Threats are created by state actors, criminal organisations and individual actors. The EU's EuroQCI initiative launched at the beginning of the year aims to build a Union-wide quantum encryption network by the end of the decade. The initiative aims to protect European critical infrastructures such as administrative functions, data centres, hospitals and energy networks. In the first phase about to begin, the aim is to build national test networks in each EU country and so create the competence needed to build operational networks. \"Quantum encryption is a new technology in which information is transmitted in the smallest possible parts – quantum – that cannot be copied. Their absence is also detected immediately, which would reveal a potential break-in attempt. Building a quantum encryption test network in Finland makes it possible to strengthen the cyber security infrastructure as part of an EU-wide system,\" says NaQCI.fi Project Manager, Principal Scientist Kari Seppänen from VTT. In Finland, VTT and CSC are responsible for the construction of the test network. It is implemented with the help of ready-made commercial devices. In addition to the public test network, the project will also build a test network for use by the authorities. Cinia and Suomen Erillisverkot Oy are responsible for its implementation. The test networks will be completed in the first half of 2024. The EU-wide network is expected to be in place by the end of the decade. \"Integrating quantum encryption into modern network services will increase in the future. Cinia finds it important to be involved in the development and provision of high-security information network services that the most critical actors in society will need in the future,\" explains Pertti Hyvärinen, Senior Vice President Business Development at Cinia Oy. \"Suomen Erillisverkot Oy wants to be active in safeguarding Finnish society against future cyber security threats. It is great to be involved in this joint project led by VTT,\" says CEO Timo Lehtimäki. In addition to the public test network, VTT is building an open trial system for quantum encryption. It can be used to develop and experiment with new components, quantum encryption methods and security analyses. The experimental system can also be used to develop software for quantum encryption test networks and to train new experts in the principles of quantum encryption. The system is built from individual components and software developed at VTT. Quantum computing is creating a new kind of threat to encryption mechanisms, as it enables effective attacks against several encryption mechanisms considered to be break-in safe from the point of view of classical computing. Quantum encryption provides a solution to these problems – the exchange of encryption keys based on quantum mechanics, which is basically impossible to break. \"We need to change our current methods for digital communication, especially for transferring sensitive data. CSC will pilot the use of quantum-secure communications for connecting end-users like hospitals, bio banks, and universities to our sensitive data services,\" says Mikael Johansson, Manager for Quantum Technologies at CSC. In quantum encryption, the exchange of encryption keys is based on the transmission of individual photons between the sender and the receiver. Because the key information to be transmitted is encoded in these individual photons, any eavesdropping can be detected by observing key transfer errors. This ensures that the keys transmitted using this method have not been compromised during the transfer. The keys can be used with existing encryption algorithms, but even higher security levels can be achieved by combining Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Finland is at the forefront of PQC development. Disposable keys can be created when extreme safety is required. The project is part of an entity in which national quantum encryption networks are set up in EU countries. In the next phase, the aim is to connect the networks with cross-border links. For this purpose, the availability of fibre connections between existing countries will be examined and preliminary experimental arrangements will be planned. In addition, the project will examine how a satellite-based quantum encryption system would suit Finnish conditions. This focuses in particular on potential problems related to satellite visibility and optical signal perception. In addition, the coordination of quantum encryption key management systems and the control and management mechanisms of quantum encryption test networks will be investigated using the necessary interfaces. Related information security and liability challenges will also be investigated. The aim of the project is also to raise",

Puukuokka, whose wooden structural engineering was carried out by Sweco, was awarded the Finlandia Prize for Architechture in 2015. Wood is a material well-suited for many kinds of construction, and its significance has increased through various environmental concerns. Puukuokka, whose name translates to a timber hoe, is a daring and ambitious project that includes the use of new technology and an ecological, human-oriented touch. Puukuokka is the first of its kind: an eight-storey timber building. The timber apartment building completed in the district of Kuokkala, in the city of Jyväskylä, in 2014 was designed by OOPEAA Office for Peripheral Architecture based in Seinäjoki, and Sweco carried out the structural engineering. It is the first of a group of three apartment buildings and it consists of 58 apartments. When complete, the entire block will comprise 150 apartments on a total of 10,500 m2 gross floor area and 17,300 m2 gross area. Timber construction demands precise calculations and research, which is why we chose to make quite comprehensive and versatile use of building information modelling (BIM). With BIM, we were able to enhance the designing process as well as the cooperation between the various parties. Puukuokka holds its own in terms of carbon footprint comparisons, living comfort and its degree of domestic origin. Puukuokka utilises renewable energy sources, and the construction project is deemed a passive energy project in accordance with the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd definition.

        "text": "A number of measures have been put in place over the years to keep power plant noise levels at an acceptable level and in line with regulations. Now, Wärtsilä and its partners have found a way to increase the quality of life for people who live near power plants while also boosting the plants' efficiency. Today more and more people are moving into cities, causing urban areas to grow and spread. With this increase in population comes a surge in demand for energy. And with the share of intermittent renewable energy sources on the rise as well, there are more opportunities for locating flexible power plants near where people live.However, energy production also, in essence, involves the generation of noise. To address the issue before it becomes – literally – too loud, Wärtsilä and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland launched a project to create innovative solutions to further reduce noise levels at power plants.The project, known as SOPEVA, is funded in part by Wärtsilä and partly by Business Finland, a public agency for research funding and international promoter for Finnish industries. The project's name is an abbreviation from the full Finnish title, which translates to \"socially acceptable energy production in varying environments.\" SOPEVA is taking place in tandem with a public project known as Anojanssi, headed by Turku University of Applied Sciences, which has been in charge of developing the perceived annoyance quantification methods utilised in SOPEVA.The goal of the project was to lower noise emissions by developing both equipment and co-operation within the entire subcontractor network.\"The aim of SOPEVA has been to respond to a need before it becomes urgent,\" explains Eirik Linde, General Manager, Environment, Wärtsilä Energy Business .\"It's not a technology we could develop on a whim; when customers ask for it, we want to meet their expectations.\" The most notable sources of power plant noises are the cooling radiators, exhaust gas stacks and ducts, combustion air intake, and ventilation, as well as the running of the engines themselves. The management of this noise has significant impacts on the ways nearby areas are affected.\"Traditionally, the exhaust system has been provided with individual components that reduce noise, especially at a certain frequency,\" says Antti Hynninen, Senior Scientist at VTT. \"Now, we considered the entire acoustic chain from the sound source to the recipient across the hearing zone. We also used the noise cancellation principle, where components attenuate each other based on the phasing of sound. At the same time, the need for insulating materials was reduced, making the components more durable and environmentally sound.\"These technologies can be utilised anywhere, from a busy metropolis to a small and remote island nation. Germany and the south of the UK, including the Channel Islands, are all places with potential for the technology. These regions have strict local regulations requiring that certain levels of noise emission be met before planning permits for new power plants are issued.A lot can be done with how the building is constructed, but not all of the possible options are practical. For example, building very thick walls to silence the noise would make a power plant project so expensive that it would no longer be a viable option. After three years, the project team had developed various solutions that reduced noise emissions by 10 to 20 decibels. In practice, this means a smaller noise footprint for a power plant, of up to 90 to 99% – a significant improvement for living conditions in nearby areas.\"In the open air, this would be equivalent to moving a kilometre away from the noise source, such as a large outdoor concert arena,\" Hynninen says. He added that for city-dwellers, the change is equivalent to wearing earplugs or closing windows to alleviate traffic noise.The project's success depended on the SOPEVA team bringing its best ideas together. \"Previously it was common in the industry that organisations were more protective of their innovations,\" Linde says. \"Today, however, collaboration is the only way forward. Through combined effort and co-operation, we can bring together the best skills from all sectors and be as agile and robust as the market expects us to be.\"SOPEVA is a clear demonstration of Wärtsilä's overall vision: enabling sustainable societies with smart technology, a goal that depends on open collaboration with partners such as VTT. About Wärtsilä Wärtsilä is a global leader in innovative technologies and lifecycle solutions for the marine and energy markets. We emphasise innovation in sustainable technology and services to help our customers continuously improve their environmental and economic performance.",

Other members of the consortium are defence and technology company Patria, Harp Technologies, a Finnish SME active in space, defence, and remote sensing technologies, and two leading, innovative Finnish universities: Aalto University and Tampere University. Finland is a leading nation of digital technologies. The state-owned VTT, founded more than 80 years ago during World War II to develop the most advanced technologies and products in the world, has previously developed ground-breaking satellite signal technology for the European Space Agency ESA, resulting in the world's first 75 GHz signals that could ease clutter on the radio waves in the future. \"The purpose of the project is to combine the expertise and technological strengths of different parties, creating highly developed solutions and advanced new expertise that can be applied to the needs of the international defence industry,\" says Sauli Eloranta, Director of Safe and Connected Society Research Area at VTT. For Finland, the project will also help strengthen the security of supply concerning the country's own technological expertise and talent. The project will, e.g., help draw new students to study and work with the subject of digital defence technologies, creating a pathway for the new professionals to join both national and international defence industry companies over time. Through indirect industrial cooperation initiatives, Lockheed Martin will build and benefit from industry partnerships with Finnish companies, universities and colleges, offering opportunities and new avenues to develop and strengthen the cooperation far into the future. \"The cooperation is a significant step for VTT and Finland at large. We are very keen on assessing additional future cooperation opportunities with Lockheed Martin. The technology cooperation offers us an opportunity to continue to develop our strong expertise in defence technologies and to increase cooperation with other defence industry actors,\" concludes Eloranta. The project is expected to last three years. Lockheed Martin and VTT are also looking to sign another framework agreement for a second project during 2023, with the work aiming to start in 2024.

Needs of the Hiedanranta district, new housing development district, in Tampere have been used as the base for the project plan. The results from the Transition Arena workshop series in the earlier RECO project were exploited also in the design framework of this new project. The target in the Transition Arena was to compose a road map and steps toward the year 2035 on how to reach and build a new carbon neutral housing district. In the Transition paths the most common combining finds were a need for new business models, how to break 'chicken and egg' situations, data control and open access interfaces and data economy issues, building regulations and codes including land transfer competition rules, and finally the needs of know-how and education of skilled labour in the transforming society. The huge change and transformation in the society challenges the ways of how things have been done earlier. Complex problems and developing world require new methods to find solutions. The development platform and ecosystem finances as the co-development tools enable ways to find systemic conclusions. The city departments and companies are often working in silos, which can make efficient development work difficult, but this can be helped by creating shared and common ways to communicate and cooperate between important actors. Actions in this project create business opportunities in local ecosystems and also pathways to identified international markets in the most advantageous financial locations. The project enhances low-carbon construction business, urban environment ICT solutions and energy production, distribution and energy efficiency themes that stem from the R&D innovation functions that has potential to become viable business.There will be as project results the new permanent development platform which will bring city departments and their needs in closer cooperation with private and public research and businesses. The community will be gathered to take forward the city development sector. Suitable common project frames will be recognized and research ideas will be taken into finance stage preparation. New business models will be identified for urban data sector in the ecosystems. Smart city block concept will be crafted as part of the long term road map for the sustainable construction. Education needs will be taken into advise for education development organizations, on both government and city level. The knowledge and education cooperation network will be created.

        "text": "Approximately one third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted. While this contributes to roughly 8 percent of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide, only 5 percent of carbon emissions in food systems are attributable to food packaging.i In this unsustainable scenario, our goal to protect the climate by minimizing carbon emissions critically relies on using the right packaging to prevent food waste. This action is also beneficial to other aspects of the environment, specifically forest conservation. By minimizing food excess, less land is needed for its production – thereby preserving swathes of woodland that would otherwise have been transformed into farms. To this end, smarter food packaging positively contributes to the protection of biodiversity and climate conservation. As counterintuitive as it may seem, when viewed from a holistic perspective, we believe that these solutions will play an instrumental role in the well-being of our planet. From an environment, economic and social point of view, food waste is far more detrimental than waste from its packaging. The severity of this issue has been noted by prominent interests, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, who assert that if food wastage were a country \"it would be the third largest [greenhouse gas] emitting state in the world.\" This fictional nation would be responsible for roughly the combined total of all road transport emissions globally.ii The true scale of food waste and its impacts have not been fully understood until now. As such, the opportunities provided by its waste reduction have remained largely untapped and underutilized.iii UNEP's Food Waste Index Report for 2021 states that a total 8 to 10 percent of GHG emissions are associated with unconsumed food. The report concludes that reducing food waste at retail, food service, and household levels can provide multi-faceted benefits to across the board. Packaging helps reduce food waste, due to its protective function. Research has shown that the environmental benefit of prevented food waste is typically 5 to 10 times higher than the environmental harm of its packaging. More definitively, product protection pays off for food groups with resource-heavy production (i.e., fast-moving perishables), whilst efficient packaging provides the optimal food preservation, using minimal recyclable or reusable materials where possible.iv Food waste increases the need for expansive farmland, which is a leading cause of the current biodiversity crisis and a large contributor to global pollution. Combined with the world's growing population and the consumption that will inevitably follow, enormous pressure is being added onto forests and natural habitats, and in many instances with irreversible effects. The Global Forest Review by the World Resources Institute has found that just seven agricultural commodities account for 26 percent of global tree cover loss between 2001 and 2015 – an area more than twice the size of Germany. At the top of the list were cattle, palm oil, and soy production; three major food industries. Whilst the hot spots of manufacturing vary by commodity, forest replacement is largely prevalent in the tropics, where biodiversity is most concentrated.v To tackle this issue, our goal is to use fiber from either recycled or certified sustainable sources.vi We are committed to minimizing our own footprint through the sustainably managed forests we use as raw materials for our packaging. In doing so, we believe that our solutions will have a larger handprintvii, i.e. positive sustainability impact, and provide added support as a counter to the forests that are in danger of becoming farmland. We believe that acting on food waste should be a key priority and topic of discussion for the upcoming COP26 climate summit. As Tesco's chief executive Dave Lewis observes in a recent edition of The Guardian, \"not a single country mentions food waste in its nationally determined contribution to the Paris climate agreement.\"viii There is a need for urgency in this issue that has generally been undermined, as confirmed by UNEP's Food Index Report who state \"this potential has until now been woefully under-exploited.\" We aim to change this scenario, starting with creating awareness to the current situation. More tangibly, driving evidence-based discussion and creating regulatory frameworks for innovation are a few methods we use to push forward progress. We believe that no single organization can solve the global sustainability challenges alone. However, with the combined efforts of multiple entities across industries, together we can create authentic differences in food protection, benefitting people and planet alike.

        "text": "Energy storage technology is one of the key technologies for the future. The demand for lithium-ion batteries – which are used in electric vehicles, industry and consumer electronics – is growing at a rate of 25% each year. Researchers at Tampere University are studying and developing new materials for fourth and fifth generation solid-state lithium-ion batteries in the collaborative NextGenBat project, which is coordinated by Aalto University, Finland, and involves multiple research institutions and companies as partners. The project participants especially focus on the study of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Finland has world-class expertise in developing these techniques that are used in growing thin films on a substrate. Tampere University's Ceramic Materials research group brings to the project extensive expertise in ceramics processing and PLD. Professor Erkki Levänen who leads the Ceramic Materials group estimates that solid-state lithium-ion batteries hold promise to reduce the consumption of raw materials by 30% or even up to 50% compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. \"The greatest potential of solid-state lithium-ion batteries lies in their energy density. We are working to make the layers of lithium as thin as possible to pack a large amount of energy into a small space. Our new solid-state batteries will not only be lighter than conventional lithium-ion batteries that use a liquid electrolyte solution but also use fewer raw materials. They also have a lower risk of catching fire,\" Levänen says. A recent breakthrough achieved by researchers at Tampere University in the study of plasticity, the ability of a material to change shape, opens up new possibilities for developing battery materials. \"One of our researchers, Erkka Frankberg, has developed amorphous thin films that are capable of plastic deformation. Being flexible, these materials could be utilised in solid-state batteries to improve reliability,\" Levänen envisions. Once the issues relating to the ageing of solid-state batteries are resolved and the production process is further refined, concrete applications will become commercially available. \"I expect the technology to be ready for market entry in a few years' time,\" Levänen estimates. The NextGenBat project is a collaborative effort between Aalto University, Tampere University, the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Pulsedeon Ltd, Beneq Ltd and Tervakoski Ltd. Tampere University carries out collaborative research in its areas of expertise with the Italian Institute of Technology and the University of Virginia, USA. The project has received €1.2 million in funding from Business Finland for the years 2021-24 and is included in the funding agency's Smart Mobility and Batteries from Finland programme.

Oma Helen palvelee ympäri vuorokauden Se helpoin tapa hankkia aurinkopaneelit Kirjoita jotakin hakukenttään. Kokeile toista hakutermiä? Helsingin Kalasatamaan rakentuvan monimuotoisen asumisen SunZeb-korttelin suunnittelu etenee. Kortteliin rakennetaan asuntoja, joissa asumisen laatu ja energiatehokkuus viedään tulevaisuuden vaatimusten tasolle. SunZEB-kortteli on pilottina EU:n MySMARTLife-projektissa, jossa testataan tulevaisuuden älykkäitä kaupunkiratkaisuja Helsingissä. Urbaaniin kaupunkiympäristöön soveltuva konsepti hyödyntää auringon energian mahdollisimman tehokkaasti. Se perustuu Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT:n ja Helenin kehittämään innovatiiviseen SunZeb-malliin, jossa rakennukset toimivat uusiutuvan energian lähteinä. Nykyisessä rakentamistavassa ongelmaksi koettu auringosta rakennuksille aiheutuva ylilämpökuorma käännetään mahdollisuudeksi. Korttelin suunnittelun edetessä konseptia on testattu mallintamalla ratkaisuvaihtoehtojen vaikutuksia energian tarpeeseen, olosuhteisiin ja kustannuksiin. Tarkastelussa on huomioitu useita muuttujia muun muassa asumisviihtyvyyden, energiatehokkuuden ja elinkaariajattelun kannalta. Hankkeen toimijat Asuntosäätiö, Fira, Kojamo ja Helen ryhtyivät ennakkoluulottomasti suunnittelemaan maailman ensimmäistä SunZeb-korttelia. Suunnitelmia on työstetty hyödyntäen Fira:n Verstas-konseptia, jossa tilaaja, tilan käyttäjät, suunnittelijat ja toteuttajat kokoontuvat yhdistämään osaamisensa ja suunnittelemaan tulevaa hanketta. - Fira:n Verstas-työmenetelmä on ollut juuri oikea tapa suunnitella uutta energiatehokasta rakennusta, jota SunZeb-konsepti edustaa. Suunnittelun aikana työpajoissa on voitu keskustella saman tien esille nousevista haasteista monesta näkökulmasta. Olen ilolla seurannut suunnitteluryhmän saumatonta yhteistyötä konseptin periaatteiden muuttamisessa käytännön suunnitteluvalinnoiksi. Asukkaille tärkeät tekijät kuten laadukkaat ja valoisat sisäolosuhteet toteutuvat energiatehokkuudesta tinkimättä, kertoo tutkimustiimin päällikkö Jari Shemeikka VTT:ltä. Arkkitehtuuriltaan korttelin ratkaisut ovat moderneja ja valoisia. SunZeb-konsepti mahdollistaa suuret ikkunapinnat ja miellyttävät sisäolosuhteet kaikkina vuodenaikoina. Kesällä auringon energia ja muut hukkaenergiat kerätään talteen ja ylilämpö hyödynnetään kaukojäähdytysjärjestelmän avulla Helsingin kaukolämpöverkossa. Talviaikaan matalalta tuleva auringon säteily lämmittää tiloja ja tuo runsaasti luonnonvaloa asuntoihin myös vuoden harmaimpina päivinä. - Korttelin sijainti on poikkeuksellisen hieno, ollaan lähellä keskustaa ja meren äärellä. Sompasaaresta muodostuu tiivis ja urbaani alue, joka on hieno kontrasti meren avoimuudelle. Varsinkin torniosasta avautuu kiinnostavia kaupunkinäkymiä kantakaupungin ja Kalasataman suuntaan ja toisaalta idässä näkyvät metsäiset Mustikkamaa ja Korkeasaari, Arkkitehtitoimisto Konkret Oy:n arkkitehti Jaakob Solla sanoo. Rakennuttajat Asuntosäätiö, Fira ja Kojamo-konserni rakentavat jokainen oman kiinteistönsä samaan korttelikokonaisuuteen. Korttelin rakentaminen käynnistyy 2018 ja ensimmäisessä vaiheessa rakennetaan Asuntosäätiön Hitas-kohde ja Kojamon Lumo-vuokrakoteja. Toisessa vaiheessa kortteli täydentyy Firan ja Asuntosäätiön kohteilla. - SunZep-konsepti sopii erinomaisesti Asuntosäätiön toimintamalliin. Haemme moderneja asumisen ratkaisuja vuokra-, asumisoikeus- ja omistusasumiseen ja tulevaisuuden älykkäät energiaratkaisut ovat juuri sellaisia. Ensimmäisen vaiheen Hitas-tuotannon jälkeen toteutamme kortteliin Helsingissä erittäin kysyttyjä asumisoikeusasuntoja, kertoo Asuntosäätiön toimitusjohtaja Esa Kankainen. - SunZeb-korttelikokonaisuus on ollut meille hankkeen alusta asti tärkeä osa ympäristöystävällisen kaupunkiasumisen kokonaisuutta. Rakentuvat Lumo-kodit tarjoavat valmistuessaan täysin uudenlaista asumisen laatua, joka on meille strategian mukaista paremman kaupunkiasumisen luomista, Kojamon kiinteistökehitysjohtaja Kim Jolkkonen sanoo. Kalasatamassa testataan tulevaisuuden älykkäitä energiaratkaisuja. Uusinta energia-, informaatio- ja viestintäteknologiaa yhdistämällä syntyy kestävän kehityksen mukainen, vähäpäästöinen energiajärjestelmä palveluineen. Vuoteen 2040 mennessä alueella on 25 000 asukasta ja 10 000 työpaikkaa. \"MySMARTLife hanke on saanut rahoitusta Euroopan unionin Horisontti 2020 tutkimus- ja innovaatio-ohjelmasta rahoitussopimuksen No 731297 mukaisesti.\" © Helen Oy 2023",

The design of the versatile residential SunZeb city block is progressing. The block will be built in Kalasatama, Helsinki. The housing quality and energy efficiency of the residences built in the area will be in line with future requirements. The SunZeb city block is the pilot project of the EU's MySMARTLife project, in which future urban smart solutions are tested in Helsinki. Suited to an urban city environment, the concept utilises solar energy as efficiently as possible. It is based on the SunZeb model developed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland together with Helen Ltd. In the model, buildings are used as renewable energy sources. The excess heating load caused to buildings by the sun, and considered problematic in the current way of building, is turned into an opportunity. As the design of the city block progresses, the concept has been tested by modelling the effects of the different solution options on energy requirements, conditions and costs. The review takes into account several variables, such as living comfort, energy efficiency and life-cycle thinking. Asuntosäätiö, Fira, Kojamo and Helen Ltd – the actors in this project – took an open-minded approach to designing the world's first SunZeb block. The designs have been worked out utilising Fira's Verstas workshop model where the customer, the users of the space, the designers and the implementers get together to combine their competencies and to design a future project. \"Fira's Verstas workshop method has provided us with exactly the right way of designing a new energy-efficient building, which the SunZeb concept represents. During the design process, the workshops have given us the opportunity to discuss emerging challenges straight off the bat from many points of view. It's been a pleasure to witness the design team's seamless collaboration to transform the principles of the concept into practical design choices. Factors important to residents, such as light high-quality indoor conditions are being implemented without compromising energy efficiency,\" says the leader of the research team Jari Shemeikka from VTT. The architectural solutions used in the block are modern and light. The SunZeb concept enables large window surfaces and comfortable indoor conditions during all seasons. In summer, excess solar energy and other waste energies are harnessed and stored. The excess heat is then utilised by Helsinki's district heating system. In winter, radiation from the low-hanging sun heats spaces and creates a lot of natural light for the apartments, even in the greyest days of the year. \"The location of the city block is exceptional – we are by the sea close to the city centre. Sompasaari will be turned into a dense urban area, which creates a stunning contrast to the openness of the sea. The tower section in particular will offer interesting urban vistas over the city centre and Kalasatama and, on the other hand, over the woody areas of Mustikkamaa and Korkeasaari in the east,\" explains Jaakob Solla, an architect at Konkret Oy. Asuntosäätiö, Fira and the Kojamo Group will each build their own property in the same city block. The construction of the block will kick off in 2018. The first phase will see the construction of Asuntosäätiö's Hitas site and Kojamo's Lumo rental apartments. The sites of Fira and Asuntosäätiö will be added during the second phase. \"The SunZeb concept fits perfectly with Asuntosäätiö's operating model. We are seeking contemporary housing solutions for rental, right-of-residence and owner-occupied residences, and the smart energy solutions of the future fit the bill. After the Hitas production in the first phase, we will build right-of-residence residences, which are in high demand in Helsinki,\" says Esa Kankainen,CEO, Asuntosäätiö. \"Right from the start of the project, the SunZeb city block has been an important part of our environmentally friendly urban housing project. Upon completion, the Lumo homes will offer brand new housing quality in line with our strategy of creating better urban housing,\" says Kim Jolkkonen, Real Estate Development Director, Kojamo. Smart energy solutions of the future are currently tested in Kalasatama. A sustainable low-emission energy system including services will be created by combining cutting-edge energy, information and communications technologies. By 2040, the area will house 25,000 residents and provide 10,000 jobs. \"The MySMARTLife project has received funding from the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme in accordance with financing agreement No 731297.\"",

        "text": "Jun 30, 2020 TactoTek® develops molded structural electronics and operates globally around the world. TactoTek® is a company that develops injection molded structural electronics and operates globally. As TactoTek's long-term partner, Berggren is responsible for managing dozens of different patent families. Berggren's strong professional expertise and industry insight has been crucial for the success of the cooperation. Good patent writing starts from the very early stages of the invention process and is carried out without detailed guidance. TactoTek's IMSE™ solutions make it possible to integrate printed electronics and surface-mount components inside injection molded 3D plastic structures. Spun off from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland in 2011, this technology company now has about 100 employees. \"Instead of an electronics device being a set of components in a box, our plastic structures are electronic components in themselves: three-dimensional, thin and lightweight,\" says TactoTek Co-Founder and CTO Antti Keränen. \"We teach our customers to design and manufacture structural electronics. In practice, we have productized our expertise into licensing packages. By adopting these packages, our customers gain the ability to design and manufacture industrialized IMSE™ (Injection Molded Structural Electronics) parts,\" adds Vice President of Product Management Sini Rytky. In addition to developing manufacturing technology, TactoTek also has a full-featured production line of its own for pilot projects. In addition to customer pilots, the production line is used in the company's own production activities to a small extent. A large proportion of TactoTek's current customers are automotive companies. However, other segments of the electronics industry are quickly increasing their relative share, with structural electronics finding its way into home appliances, thermostats, light switches, medical devices and many other applications. \"In addition to making it possible to produce attractive and smart parts, our technologies also make the localization of parts and the management of product variants significantly easier. One tool can be used to produce 20 different localized variants or more,\" Rytky explains. \"The advantage of our technology in the eyes of our customer companies is that it can be used to simplify the stages of assembly of the part in question, reduce the number of tools needed in production and increase the efficiency of the cost structure that emerges around the full product life cycle,\" Rytky adds. TactoTek has dozens of different patent families and the patent portfolio is maintained internationally. Berggren plays a big role in the management of the portfolio. As Keränen puts it, Berggren is given responsibility for the entire \"portfolio show\" starting from the drafting of applications. With dozens of patent families in play, handling patents is practically a daily occurrence. This makes it essential that the partner's expertise can be relied on. \"Berggren's highly competent employees have been a crucial aspect of our partnership. They have the insight and understanding we need. They have done a good job. When you manage a global portfolio, you also need capable agents at the country level. Berggren has a good network,\" Keränen says. \"Whenever we send out information on a new invention to Berggren, they pick up the ball and start running with it. They have some very talented people writing patent texts. All you need to do is to draw an illustration of the invention on a pack of cigarettes and they can write some good patent text based on it. We have already been granted dozens of patents, which speaks to the quality of their work,\" Keränen adds with a smile. Overall, TactoTek's partnership with Berggren has been effective and seamless. The response times are quick and communication is to the point. \"There is very good communication between us,\" Keränen points out. Subscribe to your newsletter to get latest articles.

Thi s report DOPA S W P3 Deli verabl e D3.7 fi rst gi v es an ov ervi ew of th e l ab oratory work, carried out in order to define the most suited clayish (bentonitic) material for the needs of Andra's FSS experiment, i.e. building a swelling clay core inside a test box (drift model), with the relevant \"emplaced dry density\" value and the adequate permeability performance and the most suited swelling pressure. The material used is a mix of WH2 (a bentonite brand equivalent to MX80) based pellets and powder (made of crushed pellets). It is also tested in the REM Experiment (a 10-30 year long hydration test in a metric test cell), coming as a complement to FSS, in order to assess the material performance at a scale which is ten times that of the tests carried out in lab (at a decimetric scale, over a few months) and provide data to further modelling. The document includes an overview of the main experimental phases (illustrated by photos, graphs and tables) implemented to determine the right formulation of WH2 bentonite pellets and powder admixture, first used for the bentonite material emplacement tests at a metric scale, preceding the full scale swelling clay core construction activities. The formulation selected is described and its characterization provided. The metric emplacement tests are also presented with their outcomes. They have an impact on the final bentonitic material specification effectively considered for the FSS swelling clay core construction, as well as on the design of the full-scale backfilling machine to be used in FSS. Links to previous and future Andra's FSS specific (or more general DOPAS) deliverables are given.

The fleet tests were conducted by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. They were started in May last year and ran until early 2014. The UPM BioVerno diesel fleet tests focused on investigating UPM's renewable diesel in terms of fuel functionality in engine and fuel consumption. The tests were conducted with a fuel blend including 20 per cent UPM BioVerno and 80 per cent fossil diesel. With this blend fuel consumption matched the consumption of fossil diesel. \"The fleet tests showed the same as the previous engine and vehicle tests – renewable diesel UPM BioVerno is working exactly like any regular diesel. The results were according to our expectations, because our renewable diesel echoes fossil diesel also in its chemical structure, unlike first generation biodiesels,\" says Petri Kukkonen, Vice President, UPM Biofuels. Experienced test drivers from VTT drove new Volkswagen Golf 1.6 TDI cars, provided by the VV-Auto Group, and gathered data for analysis during an altogether 80,000-kilometre test drive with four cars. The study included measurements in the laboratory at the beginning of the test and after 20,000 kilometres' driving. The approximately 20,000-kilometre test drive length was chosen based on the fact that, in Finland, the average yearly distance driven with cars is 17,000 kilometres. Analysis work at VTT was headed by Principal Scientist Juhani Laurikko. \"We studied UPM BioVerno diesel in various conditions: summer and winter weathers as well as on city roads and longer drives. The length of the drives varied from a few kilometres to several hundreds of kilometres on the road, just like real life situations. The engines of the test cars were working excellently in all conditions during the full length of the fleet testing,\" says Laurikko. Fleet testing of UPM BioVerno diesel will continue, together with VTT, using busses in the Helsinki metropolitan area in late 2014. Innovative renewable diesel UPM's renewable diesel, known as UPM BioVerno, is an innovation that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by traffic when compared with fossil fuels. This high quality biofuel is produced from residues of the forest industry, with no food materials being used. UPM BioVerno is an ideal fuel for all diesel-powered vehicles. In 2012, UPM began the construction of the first biorefinery in the world producing wood-based renewable diesel. This refinery, located in Lappeenranta, Finland, will be completed in 2014. Its production capacity will be 100,000 tonnes equating to 120 million litres of renewable diesel a year. UPM is a forerunner in the production of advanced biofuels.

        "text": "(UPM, Helsinki, 29 November 2016, 11.00 EET) - UPM has successfully tested Finnish wood-based diesel fuel both in laboratory conditions as well as in traffic. The tests clearly demonstrated that UPM's renewable diesel, UPM BioVerno, works just like the best diesel fuels. The laboratory tests of renewable UPM BioVerno diesel were conducted in the VTT Technical Research Centre (VTT) and field tests in Helsinki region bus traffic together with Helsinki Region Transport (HSL). The year-long bus field tests' measurements were done by VTT, and the tests were also supported by Transdev Finland Oy, Volvo and St1. The first laboratory tests were done with Euro III Class buses, which are still widely used on Finnish roads even today. UPM BioVerno diesel produced clearly lower emissions than fossil diesel. Compared to other advanced fuels, the emissions of UPM BioVerno diesel were at least as low as theirs. \"The use of UPM BioVerno diesel in the current bus fleet instead of fossil diesel would lower emissions from public transport significantly. This is good news as this Finnish wood-based fuel could immediately - and positively - affect the air quality in the Helsinki region,\" says Sari Mannonen, Vice President of UPM Biofuels. UPM BioVerno diesel worked well in year-long bus field tests The field tests with buses were conducted by Transdev Finland on a regular bus route between the city of Kerava and Helsinki using four identical Volvo Euro VI Class buses that have low emissions and efficient engines. The test runs were done using 20%, 50% and 100% UPM BioVerno diesel and St1 was the fuel logistics provider in the tests. According to test results, UPM BioVerno diesel is working very well in all blending ratios - just like the best diesel fuels - and fuel consumption was exactly the same. Together the four buses travelled some 400,000 km without any fuel-related incidents. The Euro VI Class buses are equipped with diesel particulate filters (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts which are capable of reducing emissions to a negligible level, so the tests did not show any significant differences in emissions between various fuels. In Euro VI Class engines the fuel affects the emissions mainly indirectly: high quality fuel, such as UPM BioVerno, guarantees that the exhaust cleaning systems operate effectively even after driving significant mileage. \"We are happy with the test results - they show that UPM BioVerno could fully replace fossil diesel in current bus traffic. Biofuels have a significant role in our company's targets, as we are aiming for carbon-free public transportation in the Helsinki region,\" says Reijo Mäkinen, head of the Traffic Services department in HSL. The bus field tests were part of a larger BioPilot project coordinated by VTT. The goal of the project was to encourage companies to commercialise renewable energy solutions in traffic. \"Advanced biofuels are a tested, well-functioning solution and a great opportunity for Finland. They could be our fast track to low emission traffic as they could be taken into use immediately and clearly cut down the emissions,\" says Research Professor Nils-Olof Nylund from VTT. HSL and VTT have started the BioSata project, which is a natural continuum for the BioPilot project which has now ended. The new project is proceeding to application phase and its target is to raise the level of biofuels used in HSL bus traffic up to 70-90% before the end of this decade. Innovative renewable diesel from Finland UPM's renewable diesel, known as UPM BioVerno, is an innovation that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% and tailpipe emissions significantly when compared with fossil fuels. This high quality biofuel is produced from a residue of the pulp industry, crude tall oil. UPM BioVerno is an ideal fuel for all diesel-powered vehicles. UPM started the production of wood based renewable diesel in the UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery in January 2015. The production capacity of the biorefinery is 120 million litres of renewable diesel annually. UPM BioVerno has been granted a Finnish Key Flag Symbol which can be granted to products that are manufactured in Finland and have a domestic origin degree of over 50%.

        "text": "(UPM, Helsinki, 14 March, 2013 at 09:00 EET) – UPM has received the Sustainability Award 2013 for Breakthrough Innovation in Technology in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The award which recognises the innovation that is taking place in the development of truly sustainable and renewable fuels is presented by the World Biofuels Markets Congress & Exhibition. UPM Biofuels received the Sustainable Biofuels Award due to its success in developing an innovative production process for an advanced renewable diesel, UPM BioVerno. So even before it goes live, UPM's renewable diesel production process has won a major international prize. The award was judged by an elite panel of independent industry experts. According to reasoning, UPM was the winner of the Breakthrough Innovation in Technology Award because of the UPM BioVerno product characteristics corresponding to traditional fuel with the greenhouse gas emissions being reduced by up to 80%. Event Director Claire Poole commented : \"The Sustainable Biofuels Awards recognise the tremendous innovation that is taking place in the development of truly sustainable and renewable fuels, and the key success factor of this novel drop-in fuel is sustainability. The feedstock is wood-based, non-food origin with no indirect land use change. A truly sustainable achievement.\" \"During the last few years we have made progress with remarkable R&D work and important investments for developing wood-based biofuels. UPM aims to become a major player in advanced biofuels so this recognition confirms that we have managed to make significant progress in this field,\" says Petri Kukkonen, Vice President of UPM Biofuels Business. Driving lower emissions with UPM BioVerno UPM BioVerno is a high quality transport fuel that works well in modern vehicles and is fully compatible with existing fuel distribution systems. UPM BioVerno has been tested for its properties, functionality, and emissions in various laboratories including VTT (Technical Research Centre of Finland) and FEV (Forschungsgesellschaft für Energietechnik und Verbrennungsmotoren GmbH) in Germany. Furthermore, UPM BioVerno decreases greenhouse gas emissions significantly. The greenhouse gas reduction of approximately 80% is calculated for the whole lifecycle taking into account all energy used in the plant and utilities used in production. UPM BioVerno is produced from crude tall oil (CTO), which is a residue from the chemical pulping process. The main phases of the process are pretreatment of crude tall oil, hydrotreatment, recycle gas purification, and fractionation. Converting CTO to biofuel is an innovative way to use that residue without changing the main process, which is pulp production. This method makes additional use of an existing UPM residue, and also avoids any raw materials that could be used for food production. \"Coming from the forest industry we benefit from our profound experience in forest biomass and extensive resources that can be used effectively for developing biofuels business and executing large scale biofuel projects,\" says Heikki Vappula, President of the Energy and Pulp Business Group in UPM. Currently, UPM is building a hydrogenation biorefinery on its Kaukas paper and pulp mill site in Lappeenranta, Finland. The biorefinery will produce 100,000 tonnes of renewable diesel for transport, equating to 120 million litres annually. The investment of EUR 150 million is the first industrial scale investment in this field globally. Site construction will be completed in 2014.

        "text": "Wärtsilä will deliver a unique fuel cell unit producing electric and heating power to the Vaasa Housing Fair site in Western Finland. The fuel cell power plant, which is based on planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology, is the first of its kind in the world. The plant is fuelled by biogas or methane originating from a nearby landfill. At the first stage, it will produce an electric output of approximately 20 kW and a thermal output of 14 to 17 kW. The fuel cell power plant delivered by Wärtsilä will produce both electricity and heating for the fair site's needs at very high efficiency. The emissions from a biogas-fuelled fuel cell are very low, which means that the solution supports the development of sustainable energy technology. Unique energy production solution for the fair site The Vaasa Housing Fair to be held between 11 July and 10 August 2008 is a pioneer in the implementation of energy production processes for a restricted area. Electricity and heating are produced and consumed within the area. In addition to fuel cells, power and heat are produced with microturbines and from low-temperature heat collected from the sea bed using a geothermal heating pump. In addition to the fuel cell plant delivery, Wärtsilä is responsible for building development and project-time financing for the power plant building at the fair site. Wärtsilä's partners in the project include Sarlin Oy, Mateve Oy, Suomen Lämpöpumpputekniikka Oy, Sonera, as well as the City of Vaasa, Vaasan Sähköverkko, Vaasan Sähkö and Vaasan Vesi. The Vaasa Housing Fair site is located in Suvilahti, approximately three kilometres east of the Vaasa city centre. Development of fuel cell technology as part of Wärtsilä's strategy The fuel cell power plant to be delivered to the housing fair site is a part of Wärtsilä's long-term fuel cell technology development project. The development of fuel cell technology is a part of Wärtsilä's long-term product development aimed at supplementing Wärtsilä's product portfolio. The fuel cell unit for the fair site is Wärtsilä's first field application of this technology. The development of environmentally friendly, cleaner and sustainable energy production technologies is an essential part of Wärtsilä's strategy. Wärtsilä is one of the leading companies in the world developing fuel cell systems based on SOFC technology. The development is supported by close collaboration with the Danish company Topsoe Fuel Cells A/S and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The characteristics of SOFC technology include a high operating temperature, excellent efficiency and the ability to use several different fuels, particularly natural gas and biogases. Fuel cell technology is indeed regarded as one of the most promising forms of energy production in the future. Wärtsilä's centre of competence for this technology is located at Otaniemi in Espoo. The Vaasa engine laboratory is also involved in fuel cell development. The landfill gas used by the fuel cell power plant is a renewable fuel, which means that fuel cell technology is compliant with the energy and climate package of the EU Commission. EU requires Finland to increase the share of renewable sources from the present 28.5 per cent to 38 per cent of energy production by 2020. The significance of biogases increases in decentralised energy production. The benefits of decentralised energy production include more efficient utilisation of local sources of energy, shorter transport distances for fuels and reduced energy transmission losses. Biogas-based fuels are energy sources compliant with sustainable development. In addition to landfills, biogases are generated in agriculture and water treatment plants, for example.

We change the strategies how all kinds of vehicles are moved within car plants, depots and logistics yards, by completely automating driving and services – safely controlled by our infrastructure. Facts & Figures Our story Sustainability Media Room Offices & Contacts Unikie has assumed a leading role in developing software for the manufacturing industry. It is one of the first international operators to develop smart industrial solutions for secure real-time processes and applications. A couple of years ago, Unikie initiated the launch of the VAMOS ecosystem project facilitated by Dimecc. Its ambitious goal is to boost the symbiosis between software development and industry and to rise to a new level faster than any individual company could. \"The progress of digitalisation within the machinery industry is not just the IT department's responsibility. It is a strategic business decision by the company management that impacts the opportunities for success of the entire business,\" says Esko Mertsalmi, the founder of Unikie. \"Digitalisation should not be seen as just software or a service; it is a comprehensive change that affects the entire production chain, operational methods, and the end products. It is a new way of thinking about business and its possibilities,\" he continues. The competitiveness of the technology field is highly dependent on continuous innovation, developing new technology, and smart utilisation of digitalisation. Unikie's Mertsalmi highlights the significance of the VAMOS ecosystem to Finnish companies, as well as the important strategic focus on nearby markets: \"Germany is a massive and promising market near us, where people understand industrial operations and appreciate the added value that our software offers, especially to the automotive industry.\" The green transition adds to the digitalisation pressure of manufacturing industry, guiding it towards focusing on electrical machinery instead of combustion engines. This transition will open new markets to agile operators, and Unikie has a key role in creating this kind of competitive edge. Software development not only makes production more efficient, but it also gives the machinery intelligence that the industry can utilise to reduce its carbon footprint. \"It is clear to us that all our customers are unique, and it is our duty to provide them with solutions that best serve our customers' business objectives,\" Mertsalmi states. \"All in all, our work is not just about the technology; it's strategic business development together with our customer,\" he adds. \"Business Finland's funding for the ecosystem operations in Finland allows us to fully focus on what we do best: creating software technology that will take Finnish manufacturing industry to a new era while maintaining its competitiveness,\" Mertsalmi summarises. Thanks to the intelligent solutions Unikie has developed for the automotive industry and ports, it is also able to cost efficiently provide exceptional added value to technology companies that manufacture work machinery. Developing autonomous systems is not just a trend – it is essential. Harri Kulmala, managing director at Dimecc – a provider of industrial innovation platforms and the VAMOS ecosystem – states that automation is not a new concept, but its development has now reached a critical point. \"Unikie brings world-class software solutions to the market. They do not only meet the demands of today, but also predict the future challenges of the manufacturing industry,\" Kulmala continues. Kulmala describes Unikie's role in the VAMOS ecosystem as significant: \"The ability to work side-by-side with the manufacturing industry is a key factor in developing innovations. Individual coders or small in-house teams alone cannot meet the extensive needs for change within the manufacturing industry.\" Finnish companies have a solid reputation as manufacturers of reliable, safe, and durable work machinery, with forestry machines as an excellent example. The next development stage will add even more intelligence and autonomous movement to heavy work machinery and equipment. Unikie's customers include several leading automotive and machine manufacturers, industrial companies, telecommunication operators, and international research institutes. Examples of the company's world-class customers include Nokia, Ponsse, Sandvik, Valmet, and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. Unikie's diverse technological competence and experience with the needs of manufacturing industry are seen in their commitment to long-term solutions. \"The service life of work machinery ranges from 20 to 30 years, which is why it is our responsibility to make sure that our intelligent solutions can be sea",

Up to date, International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations on air pollution have addressed mainly SOx and NOx emissions but the awareness of particle matter and black carbon emissions is growing due to their negative impact on global warming and human health. Whereas SOx scrubbers can reduce particulate matter and black carbon emissions with limited efficiency, a combination of a wet scrubber and a wet electrostatic precipitator could capture these emissions almost completely from a ship's exhaust gas. \"At VTT, we had already studied the emissions of ships that have a marine scrubber installed. This way we had experience of the challenging measurement conditions related to scrubbers and also comparable data on the emission reduction potential of the new setup,\" says VTT's Senior Scientist Kati Lehtoranta. Additionally, VTT had a medium-speed diesel engine that runs on heavy fuel oil, the equipment for demanding pilot tests, top experts and the scientific know-how to publish the test results. \"The solution we tested brings so many benefits that we believe it has great potential. Emission regulations are bound to tighten in the upcoming years. Valmet now has a solution that can be installed both on newbuilds and already operating vessels that still use conventional fuels. That enables shipping companies to significantly reduce particle emissions, while continuing their operation normally,\" says Juha Jokiluoma, Product Manager at Valmet. Valmet has piloted a first-of-a-kind combination of a scrubber and a wet electrostatic precipitator in a marine diesel engine together with VTT. By cutting particle and black carbon emissions by up to 99%, the solution would allow for a more sustainable operating environment for the shipping industry. Technical information about Valmet Wet Electrostatic Precipitator Valmet Wet Electrostatic Precipitator – WESP, Wet ESP – is used to control emissions, including particulate emissions, heavy metals, acid mist, oil mist and visible plume. Its operation is based on a very strong electrical field between discharge electrodes and collecting tubes created by a transformer rectifier. Valmet WESP can be integrated to Valmet DNA's user interface or other distributed control systems as well as utilize new Valmet Industrial Internet (VII) features. Technical information about Valmet's marine scrubbers Valmet offers two basic types of exhaust gas scrubbers. Its open loop scrubber uses seawater as wash water, and its closed loop scrubber circulates the wash water and uses alkaline chemicals to capture sulfur. A hybrid scrubber combines both operation modes and can easily switch between the open and closed loop operation modes. Valmet was the first company to introduce this new-generation hybrid scrubber. The wash water from both the scrubber and the WESP systems can be efficiently treated in Valmet Water Treatment System (WTS) to fulfill the IMO regulations. Valmet has developed scrubbers since the 1970s and delivered more than 300 scrubbers onshore and offshore.

The project, co-funded by Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes), involves several industry, research institute and academic partners such as Nokia, Teleste, Telia, ABB, Cargotec Kalmar, Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle), Digita, regulator FICORA, key Finnish universities as well as VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. Tens of billions of connected devices will converge into intelligent and programmable systems that will improve lives in a vast number of areas over the next 10 years, according to some predictions. Transportation and resource consumption, learning and work, treatment of health and wellness will all be affected by this change which will bring massive opportunities for these industries, but also new capacity requirements for the networks. The WIVE project, which is planned to run for 2 years, will focus on the needs of specific vertical sectors. The WIVE project addresses the following vertical sectors: • Media and entertainment (M&E) • Machine type connectivity for application areas, including: •Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), serving sectors like smart grids and remotely controlled machines • Massive Machine Type Connectivity (mMTC), allowing high amount of devices to be connected with limited cost and energy consumption. The WIVE project targets to develop concepts and enable technologies, as well as to test and experiment new vertical services offered by 4G/5G especially for URLLC, mMTC, and media content delivery. These new communication services have versatile requirements e.g. for reliability, latency, data rates, security, and availability. The WIVE project aims at demonstrating that these requirements can be fulfilled with future 4G/5G networks with improved flexibility and cost-efficiency. The WIVE project implements vertical service pilots based on industry driven use cases on the top of 5GTNF testbeds (e.g. TAKE-5 and 5GTN+) and tests new vertical services and applications in a realistic testing environment (out of laboratory) to discover possible technical and business opportunities and constraints associated with new technologies in order to speed up the roll out of new vertical services in 5G. Spectrum is one of the key enablers for the exploitation of the full innovation potential of 5G. Therefore, WIVE takes an active role in investigating and promoting flexible spectrum policies and spectrum management schemes to unlock new spectrum assets for 5G. A vital part of WIVE is the focus on the user dimension and identifying business opportunities for different verticals. 5G enables innovative service concepts and business cases across industries, as devices and machines are increasingly connected, paving the way for new business models and markets to emerge in the connected world. The WIVE project takes content consumption patterns and routines among end-users into account when exploring new business opportunities and scenarios for 5G. The fast paced technology development in the fields of Massive Machine Type Connectivity (mMTC), Internet of Things (IoT) and Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) such as Digita's LoRa network are promoting the growth of ecosystems of companies utilizing these technologies, and is enabling the emergence of whole new business concepts. Collaboration projects like WIVE are crucial in driving this development, comments Ari Kuukka from Digita. \"The number of connected devices in the Internet of Everything era will pose new challenges to future networks from both interoperability, scalability and reliability perspectives. WIVE has a lot to contribute here as part of and in collaboration with the 5G Test Network Finland – on top of the media business transformation activities bridging the work from the preceding research activities in the FUHF (Future of UHF) project\", says Program Manager Mika Klemettinen from Tekes. \"Industry collaboration is essential in fostering innovation around 5G, and for enabling different industries to take full advantage of the faster connections that 5G promises. Nokia Bell Labs has a strong focus on ultra reliable low latency communications targeting new wireless communication systems for verticals, and the WIVE project provides us with greater insight into the requirements and opportunities for experimentation to test our solutions\", underlines industrial coordinator of the project, Mikko Uusitalo, Head of Research Department on Wireless Advanced Technologies, from Nokia.

The project aimed at the development of an Urban Transformation Strategy to support cities in the definition of transition models and progressing to the smart people and smart economy concepts. Overall objectives of project mySMARTLife were: Read more about the project on Fundacion CARTIF project website. Project mySMARTLife expected to reach the following results: Find the public deliverables for Demonstration in Lighthouse City Helsinki on Fundacion CARTIF project website. With previous experience on real-life demos of the autonomous electric buses in Finland, the mySMARTLife project addressed local urban mobility issues with electric autonomous bus pilot lines. Metropolia University of Applies Sciences' main role in the project was the definition, deployment and monitoring pilot operations in Helsinki demonstration area. Two automated bus pilots were carried out, in 2018 in Kivikko and in 2019 in Kalasatama. Both pilots lasted about six months. The majority of passengers came to try the bus, not the robot bus route being part of their regular journey. In general, passengers were satisfied with the ride. The main criticisms were the speed of the bus and the hard braking. During the pilots in Helsinki, there were many situations where the operator had to intervene and overtake the bus. Typically these were narrow streets, human-driven traffic, and street-side parking. Robotic buses need parking space, charging infrastructure and a maintenance depot. At this stage also the field staff involved in the operation. Problems will arise, if the \"last mile\" routes for the robotic buses are located far from existing maintenance services. Routes had to be chosen on the basis of what the buses could do, rather than where there was demand. Currently the automated buses would best serve people with disabilities, for whom even short short walking distances are challenging. This group of users should be given special consideration in the development of vehicles and designing the corresponding services. However, the operator is not intended to assist the passengers physically. As a conclusion, an electric vehicle is not automatically sustainable but it depends on the conditions in which the vehicle is operated and how the electricity it uses is generated. Additionally, the sustainability is related to how the vehicle is manufactured. In order to achieve sustainable results, the robotic buses should reduce the use of private cars by making public transport more attractive, and more accessible. This can be achieved by increasing by complementing existing bus routes or sometimes, replacing them. However, if robotic buses replace only walking and cycling, CO2 emissions will not be reduced. The potential uses and benefits of robotic buses in the near future can be briefly listed as follows: Overall, these automated bus pilots received a lot of positive attention both from nationally and internationally. Despite the current challenges, the automated future looks bright. If smartly organised, they will improve the coverage and service of the public transport network. This would make a significant contribution to the future of the bus industry as a more sustainable transport system.

Hiekan käyttäminen suuressa mittakaavassa edellyttää vielä lisätestauksia, jotta sitä voitaisiin mahdollisesti hyödyntää käytännössä. Turvemaiden kunnostusojitusten ja maanmuokkauksen yhteydessä vesistöihin liukenee orgaanista ainetta, jota ei saada pois laskeutusaltailla eikä pintavalutuskentillä, jotka pysäyttävät kiintoaineen. Valumavesiin liuennut orgaaninen aines nostaa veden biologista hapenkulutusta sekä värjää ne ruskeiksi. Metsä Groupissa on muutaman vuoden ajan tutkittu tuotannon sivuvirroissa syntyvien materiaalien kykyä puhdistaa turvemaiden ojaverkostosta otettua vettä. Tutkittavana on ollut 16 eri sivuvirtamateriaalia. Tavoitteena on ollut sekä löytää materiaaleille uutta käyttöä että vähentää turvemaiden metsänhoidon haittoja. \"Havaitsimme laboratoriotesteissä, että turvemaiden ojaverkostosta haettu ruskea vesi kirkastui, kun se johdettiin polttolaitoksen leijupetikattilan käytöstä poistetusta petihiekasta tehdyn suodattimen läpi. Humusaineet reagoivat suodattimen aineiden kanssa ja sakkautuivat. Testasimme petihiekkaa myös pienimuotoisissa kenttäkokeissa\", kertoo kestävän kehityksen johtaja Vesa Junnikkala. Ilmiön tarkka syy jäi Metsä Groupin omissa tutkimuksissa epäselväksi ja Metsä Group pyysi Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT:tä selvittämään, mistä vesiä puhdistava vaikutus johtuu. \"Petihiekka sisältää esimerkiksi kalsiumia, alumiinia ja rautaa, joiden tiedetään muodostavan saostumia humusaineksen kanssa. Petihiekkakäsittelyillä pystyttiin vähentämään erityisesti vesien kemiallista hapenkulutusta ja vähentämään värillisten komponenttien määrää\", kertoo VTT:n tutkija Joni Lehto. \"Kierrätettyä leijupetihiekkaa voidaan käyttää sellaisenaan edullisena materiaalina humuksen poistoon esimerkiksi happamista metsäojavesistä, mutta se vaatii lisätutkimuksia. Nyt tehdyt testit perustuvat laboratoriomittakaavan kokeisiin, joten hiekan käyttäminen käytännössä ja suuremmassa mittakaavassa vaatii lisätestausta\", Lehto arvioi. Projektin tulokset on julkaistu Environmental Technology -lehdessä keväällä 2021. \"Tulosten julkaisulla haluamme varmistaa, että havainto on vapaasti kaikkien tahojen hyödynnettävissä. Toivomme, että uudet tulokset innoittavat jatkokehittämään petihiekan käyttöä valumavesien puhdistuksessa\", Junnikkala sanoo. Petihiekan laajempi käyttö vaatii selvityksiä muun muassa siitä, voiko petihiekasta rakentaa esim. pistemäisiä imeytyskenttiä, joihin humuspitoiset vedet johdetaan ja kuinka usein hiekka pitäisi vaihtaa. On myös selvitettävä, millaisen jatkokäsittelyn tehonsa menettänyt hiekka vaatii vai voidaanko se jättää paikoilleen. Esimerkkikuva täällä (vain verkkoresoluutio saatavilla).

The automatic traffic test area in Hervanta, Tampere, is an example of the future of urban development. The digital twin of Hervanta is a versatile and user-friendly service design tool. Just one click and you are there: On the screen, you have a bird's-eye view of a 3D model of Hervanta, a suburb of Tampere. When you scroll closer to the streets, you will be surprised how detailed the model is. All the traffic signs and bus stops are in place and the weather conditions are realistic. Another click and you are inside a car. You can drive the car around the model and activate various data streams that you might find useful. In the near future, services created by using digital twins will become a more normal part of urban life. A digital twin is like an ever-growing and developing sandbox for urban developers to play in. It is a framework for real-life services. In the near future, services created by using digital twins will become a more normal part of urban life. Their global market value is increasing at dazzling speed – even the most conservative estimates predict that the market value will increase tenfold over the next five years. Finnish developers have also jumped on this bandwagon. In addition to the tests in Tampere, digital twins have been utilised in urban development in Helsinki and Oulu. In Oulu, Sitowise created an accurate model of the city port. Digital modelling is not exactly a new phenomenon. Digital twins have been used in shipbuilding and designing of factory production lines for several years. Now urban development has adopted the technology. Thanks to cities creating 3D models of urban spaces, visual digital twins have become more accessible and less cumbersome tool of urban development. In Hervanta, the model is being used for training automated vehicles, for example. Tramway traffic operation will begin in Tampere in August 2021. There are plans to introduce driverless vehicles to assist tramway feeder traffic. These vehicles would transport people to tramway stops. The vehicles would operate in an area of about one square kilometre around the Ahvenisjärvi lake. In this case, the digital twin is a platform for teaching vehicles to move safely around the area. -This pilot project is linked to a larger European project called SHOW (SHared automation Operating models for Worldwide adoption). The project pilots automatic traffic solutions. We are acting as the Finnish coordinator of SHOW. The City of Tampere supports the development of smart mobility strongly, and all their projects benefit each other, says Laura Riihentupa, Project Manager at Sitowise and Coordinator at ITS Factory. To a user, the digital twin of Hervanta created by Sitowise looks like a combination of several visualised data streams and pleasing graphics. This is not the first digital twin created of Tampere. 3D simulation of urban spaces have been used for training tram drivers, for example. Digital twins have been utilised in Tampere for a few years now. All the new areas in the city centre have already been modelled. For example, the locations of buildings under development can be viewed digitally before construction has even begun. This makes urban development easier. Jari Ikonen, Business Tampere In order to provide reliable support for ambitious projects such as training driverless cars, digital twins must meet high quality standards and depict the real word as accurately as possible. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland played a key role in the project. VTT modelled unnoticeable but important objects, such as traffic signs and bus stops, and measured the coverage of a 5G test network in the area. - In the Hervanta project, the accuracy of the model was, at best, as close as 10 centimetres. This helped us ensure that the model's traffic signs and public transport stops took exactly the same amount of space as they take in real life, says Automated Vehicle Scientist Kimmo Kauvo from VTT. Over the past few years, digital twins have been introduced in urban development along with several significant technological leaps. The current level of 3D modelling, availability and amount of sensor data and standardisation of important technologies make utilising digital models easier than ever before. - Telecommunication networks are now so fast that they allow almost real-time utilisation of sensor data. The City of Tampere is a pioneer in making city interfaces accessible and piloting new services. For example, anyone can access the city's traffic light data if they are interested, says Riihentupa. Game engines have also become more useful tools of urban development. The digital twin of Hervanta was created using a Unity game engine, which works well for projects of this scale. The rapid development of game engines has helped digital twins become more common in the field. Technical advisor Niko",

        "text": "Published: 22.11.2018 National 5G projects co-operate in showcasing the delivery of the Finnish broadcasting company Yle´s live TV channels in mobile wireless network. For the first time in Finland two areas are lit up, and selected commercial smartphones are enabled to receive live streams in Oulu and Espoo 5G test networks using evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS) technology. \"Most importantly, those Formula 1 or Ice-Hockey finals will not crash at mobile anymore due to peak traffic congestion. In fact, research shows that networks not leveraging broadcast waste a massive amount of spectrum for delivering the most popular content!\", says Mikko Uitto, Research Scientist from VTT. Studies show that mobile traffic will grow by at least eight times in the next five years, and video is the largest contributor to this growth. For example Finns consume already over 10GB of data per month, for which video streaming takes the largest share. In parallel, the number of connected things will double in the same timeframe which means even less bandwidth for everyone to go around. eMBMS is widely regarded as a savior technology that allows service providers to deliver more services more efficiently, and to economically cope with the traffic growth the market will live to see in the next few years. eMBMS offers also new chances for new business. This includes national emergency alerting and critical communications delivery to police forces and fire departments, connected cars to exchange critical information such as speed and location in real-time, and operating system and application updates to prevent security breaches and hacking. All these cases demand networks with higher reliability which is now feasible with broadcast. \"Our objective is to be part of the future media delivery development and 5G networks will be part of this. Digita is actively developing head-end, the CDN and Transmission side of 5G broadcasting. We are currently planning to set up a HTHP (High Tower, High Power) eMBMS pilot in the capital region in Finland in the spring 2019\", says Henri Viljasjärvi, Business development director, Digita. \"Yle aims to ensure that our content is available and easily accessible across all networks and all kinds of user terminals and platforms. Our goal is to offer the best public service media experience to the Finnish people and to be the most important media in Finland. In order to reach that goal we also need to be a bold innovator, as it is stated in our strategy. With 5G network broadcasting we can reduce production implementation and costs, while maintaining the broadcast quality and reliability\", says Olli Sipilä, CTO from the Finnish broadcasting company Yle. \"We aim to provide a platform for innovation and co-development using 5G technologies. We take a pragmatic approach to make the technology easily available to researchers, start-ups, SMEs and others to untap their creativity and design new forward thinking applications and services\", says Jose Costa Requena from Aalto University. \"5G offers ample opportunities to introduce new novel services. Turku University of Applied sciences is focused on developing and trialling 5G technologies for new services together with the industry, and media distribution is an important component\", says Jarkko Paavola from Turku University of Applied Sciences states. The technology used for these projects is supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The end-to-end eMBMS solution into 5GTN is provided by Expway, a company specialized in eMBMS IP broadcasting over 5G. \"Expway provides its eMBMS solutions to leading operators and device makers around the world. We are delighted to provide a similar end-to-end solution, for the benefit of this Finnish 5G eco-system as well. In fact I could not think of better place to showcase it, as no other folks in the world are as data-hungry at mobile, as the Finnish folks are!\", says Ulla Saari, VP Business Development of Expway The demonstration is part of a multidisciplinary co-operation of 5G research projects, TAKE-5, WIVE and 5GTN+ including the companies in the media (YLE) and network technology (Digita, Expway and Nokia) industries and research institutes (Aalto University, Turku University of Applied Sciences, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland).

        "text": "Oulun Energia, Caverion and Osuuskauppa Arina have entered into a tripartite agreement to implement an energy production system in around ten Osuuskauppa Arina properties in Oulun Energia's business area. The ambition is to complete the sites by 2025. The companies' joint innovation will increase cost-effective, carbon-neutral district heating production by using waste and condensing heat from commercial properties. In addition, a new way to manage energy flows will provide a concrete and locally feasible means to curb climate change. The project can be implemented thanks to a two-way district heating system into which energy can be injected from several different sources. The energy production system itself is based on utilising the waste heat from the property's CO2 refrigeration plant and the energy of the heat pump connected to the plant in the district heating network. The two-way district heating system will be controlled by Caverion's automation system, which is integrated into the control systems of Oulun Energia and the building. \"This project reinforces our view that, in cooperation with different actors, we will be able to develop solutions that create a sustainable energy system for the future. As a responsible leader, we are committed to doing our share to reach carbon neutrality both locally and nationally,\" says Juha Juntunen, CEO, Oulun Energia. Osuuskauppa Arina's new S-Market opened in the Ritaharju district of Oulu in March and is the first property to operate the new energy production system. The waste heat from the property's refrigeration equipment is recovered for the property's own needs and some is pumped into Oulun Energia's district heating network. Calculations show that the system installed in Ritaharju will enable production of as much as 3 GWh of district heat a year. At the same time, carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced by around 500 tonnes, which corresponds to the emissions caused by heating around 170 detached homes. The sites implemented by 2025 will multiply district heat production and emissions reductions. \"As a leader in efficient store energy solutions, we are also setting an example in the climate campaign and the new jointly-developed energy production system will speed up our journey towards reaching carbon neutrality by 2025;\" enthuses Reima Loukkola, CEO at Osuuskauppa Arina. The innovation has great social significance in reaching carbon neutrality. Made in Finland, the technology can produce emission-free energy for local use and to inject clean energy into the district heating network. Locally-produced clean energy is also highly important for security of supply, since it further reduces purchases of fossil energy from abroad. Broader use of the innovation calls for a new approach to regional planning and the use of modern M&E solutions so that energy flows can be managed appropriately. The new energy production solution offers planners, investors, developers, energy companies, M&E system experts and property maintenance professionals new insights in the implementation of resource-wise solutions. VALOR Partners Oy and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland were also involved in verifying the energy production system calculations.

        "text": "Enabled by foam forming technology, VTT's formable cellulose-based webs with 30% extensibility were used to make rigid packages using an industrial product packaging line. This opens up the manufacturing of a wide range of sustainable packaging solutions. In a pilot-scale study to find alternative raw materials for rigid plastic packages, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland has obtained unprecedented maximum limits of its highly extensible formable cellulose-based webs used for rigid packaging applications. The results enable the manufacturing of a wide range of sustainable 3D packaging solutions that were previously unattainable. Typical commercial boards have between 3–6% extensibility (geometrical mean) and best commercial formable boards have 10–18% extensibility. By utilising foam forming technology, VTT has now obtained up to 30% extensibility. This enables brand owners to use rigid, cardboard-like packaging to serve consumers looking to buy more sustainable products. This material improvement enables e.g. food brands producing cold cuts to increase cardboard-like package size from 75 grams up to 200-250 grams. By adjusting the tray forming process and tray dimensions even larger cardboard-like packages can be produced. \"Polypropylene film is one of the world's most used polymers – its extensibility is up to 300%. Our invention now offers a viable, sustainable alternative on the market,\" says Jarmo Kouko, Research Team Leader at VTT. \"There's been a lot of great academic research around the world on how to eliminate plastics, but the challenge is that those seldom go beyond research. So, we're extremely excited and proud of the results we've produced in our pilot-scale study, which clearly shows the commercial potential of our rigid cellulose-based packaging. In industries that use huge amounts of plastic like the food packaging sector, we can find plenty of opportunities to reduce the use of fossil fuel based materials and replace them with sustainable ones that take us closer to carbon-neutral societies of the future and allow us to be more frugal with natural resources,\" he continues. With the Single-use Plastics Directive and the European Commission's proposal for Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, plastic items like expanded polystyrene (EPS) food containers and cups have been banned in the European Union since 2021, and producers of single-use plastic products are expected to cover the costs of waste management for these products. Solutions like VTT's foam-formed cellulose-based packaging give suppliers a sustainable and affordable alternative to single-use plastic. \"The fact that VTT, together with gruppo x di x gruppo s.r.l. and Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT), were able to incorporate the product into existing product packaging lines with no changes in the process, making it affordable and easy for brands to adopt the product as a sustainable alternative to plastic packages can be a real game-changer,\" says Kristian Salminen, Lead, Bio-based Products at VTT. The development work has been conducted as a part of a research program, where VTT in co-operation with 54 companies and Regional Council of Central Finland have up-scaled promising alternatives for plastic products. The VTT behind the research are to present their findings at The Greener Manufacturing Show 2023 in Cologne, Germany between November 8–9.

FSS (\"Full-Scale Seal\") is the seal demonstrator at scale 1:1, designed and built by Andra with the scientific help of NAGRA, while other WMO's (the DOPAS partners) have built their own plug or seal prototypes.

Design and selection of the shotcrete mix (formulation) followed a multi-step process, and various parameters were used in a global multi-criteria analysis. The preferred solution was a binary mix, with the selection particularly affected by the pH and compressive strength of the mix (these activities are described in other separate and specific WP3 FSS related reports). While the casting of the low-pH SCC containment was totally successful, some problems were encountered with the low pH shotcrete plug, notably the management of rebounds and the formation of bonding discontinuities between layers. Furthermore, the low pH shotcreteAndra - Dopas D3.13 - Report on FSS shotcrete plug construction – version A 4 formulation was difficult to mix at plant and its behaviour (once applied as a layer) was very sensitive to the amount of activator incorporated in the mix at gun level. Locally, the hardening temperature reached inside the concrete monolith was above the specified requirement. Ways for improvements are identified in this report concerning the formulation and use of low pH shotcrete, even if the use of low pH SCC appears, at time of writing, as the reference solution for building plugs in the future Cigéo. The use of low pH shotcrete would be most likely limited to \"small preparation works\", such as physically separating the drift ordinary backfill (when closing the geological repository, the drifts will be backfilled with argillite) from the SCC containment wall.

Outokumpu Corporation News August 12, 2024 Outokumpu to take the next steps in metal powder production with several co-operation and public-funded projects Outokumpu, the global leader in sustainable stainless steel, entered the metal powder market for additive manufacturing nearly a year ago by piloting to produce metal powder at its production site in Krefeld, Germany in April 2023. Outokumpu's target is to further strengthen the company's ambitious innovation strategy and circular economy efforts by producing annually up to 330 tons of metal powder from the company's own recycled material, 100% stainless steel scrap. Upon completion of the first trial-year, the company is now entering into commercial production phase. On top, several research and development co-operation projects will be started with companies from a wide range of industries that want to use steel powder for new innovative products. Outokumpu has been entering a collaboration with steel trading company STAHL KREBS, as part of the public funded project REACT** by German government. Another collaboration in the pipeline is within the medical and jewelry industry to work on nickel-free materials, which can be used for implants, medical tools and watches. The collaboration is taking place via a public funded project by EIT Raw Materials, HiPAM***, led by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. \"Additive manufacturing is one of the key technological innovations of the 21st century and will also play an important role in the green transition of global economies. Markets for metal powder in additive manufacturing have grown massively in recent years and are expected to continue growing until the end of the decade. According to Fortune Business Insights, the total volume of the global metal powder market was USD 6.75 billion in 2021, with expected growth to USD 10.79 billion by 2029*. Our ambition is to make significant contribution to this development by using the steel scrap from local production to create new solutions to the market. Following the test and ramp-up phase, we are now able to start supplying customers and cooperation partners with high-quality, low-emission metal powder for 3D printing\", says Marten Franz, Head of Metal Powder Business at Outokumpu. Solutions for demanding applications Outokumpu's primary focus is on producing metal powders that are not yet on the market – suited for companies that use technologies to produce parts for demanding specialty applications. To support customer-specific requirements, Outokumpu operates its proprietary test laboratory, where the applications can be modified and validated directly on site. \"We are convinced that a sustainable and profitable economy can only be achieved with a circular approach that combines technological openness and resource conservation. Together with our partners, we want to take a big step towards this goal during 2024. In addition, new material developments and qualifications are taking place to expand the portfolio of stainless metal powder by utilizing our 100-yearlong material knowledge within the stainless flat products such as better corrosion or thermal resistant material to support energy and aerospace sector,\" Franz continues. *) Metal Powder Market Share, Growth & Trends Analysis [2029] (fortunebusinessinsights.com) **) Inforegio - REACT-EU (europa.eu) ***) Eco-designed High Performance Alloy for AM and PM — VTT's Research Information Portal More information: Outokumpu media desk, tel. +358 40 351 9840, e-mail media(at)outokumpu.com Outokumpu Corporation Engage with Outokumpu in social channels © Outokumpu 2024 Contact us We are here to help.

Ancient philosophers and cur - rent day cognitive scientists have tried to understand what makes the human brain the ultimate tool and such a unique instrument. The ability to learn new things is a lifelong process and different individuals absorb knowledge differently depend-ing on their specific backgrounds. Experience and age are commonly perceived to be the main determinants when analysing the development of a person's cognitive ability. One should not, however, underestimate the importance of motivation, emotion and a healthy life style in successful learning processes. According to cognitive scientists intelligence and learn- ing ability take various forms. Components such as percep - tion, memory, association, concept formation, problem solv- ing and mental imagery play an important role when trying to figure out the holistic outcome of the learning process. Some educational institutes offer scholars courses such as \"Theory of Knowledge\" in their curriculums. Students are en- couraged to discover the views of and justifications for dif-ferent issues, rather than debating the rights or wrongs of those phenomena. The strength of mankind lies also in our ability to work together and produce something called \"group cognition\" . In addition to traditional physical group work, collaborative learning can benefit from different networks that can easily be accessed across digital media applications. It is not farfetched to claim that nations without vast amounts on natural resources are particularly dependent on their ability to innovate and create opportunities to remain competitive. In addition to various academic institutions and research centres, engineering companies play an important role in creating wealth through innovation and research. This technical journal is an example of the intellectual capacity that a modern engineering company must possess and de - liver for the benefit of its customers. Hopefully reading the articles will provide you with a positive learning experience and a healthy challenge to your cognitive learning abilities.

As part of the LigniOx project consortium, Fortum Bio2X has committed to developing new, sustainable concrete superplasticizers that will be based on lignin. Lignin, the second most abundant biopolymer on earth, is currently under-utilized in commercial applications. Fortum has provided straw-based lignin for the LigniOx project's process development and application testing, which has demonstrated positive results. The consortium consists of several companies, ANDRITZ Oy, Dow, CIMV, Metsä Fibre, St1 and Vertech Group, as well as the research organizations VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and VITO. \"Concrete is the most common material used in the construction industry. Plasticizers are needed to improve the workability of concrete. The current high-performance plasticizers on the market are mainly fossil-based, and there is a growing demand for new, sustainable alternatives that are also cost-competitive\", says Hanne Wikberg, Development Manager of Fortum Bio2X. The new biobased concrete plasticizers have already shown positive performance at laboratory scale. Product performance will also be demonstrated in industrial conditions by field tests. The goal is to verify that they can reach product requirements that are acceptable in the market and fulfil the construction industry's needs. Commercialization for the technology is expected to start soon after October 2021 when the project ends. The LigniOx technology used in the project is based on VTT's patent, and the project is funded by Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking and the EU. Fortum's Bio2X programme is part of Fortum's strategy to build options for new businesses that improve resource efficiency. Bio2X focuses on fractionating non-edible agro biomass to high-quality cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin fractions that can replace current fossil-based and other unsustainable materials in various bioproducts.

Over the following pages are excerpts from the enthusiastic panel discussion that was held at the Confederation of European Paper Industries' (CEPI) headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Elina Pääkkönen, M.Sc (Tech) – Research Scientist, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. Frederik Rosén, MBA, M.Sc – Vice President, Market Strategy & Business Development, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden (formerly Innventia) Esa Torniainen – Founder, Chief Business Development Officer, Paptic Ltd. Bernard De Galembert – Innovation and Bioeconomy Director, Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) Johan Engström – Chief Technology Officer, ANDRITZ Mark Rushton – Pulp & Paper Industry Consultant There is no doubt that fantastic opportunities are being presented to the pulp and paper industries, particularly as plastic products currently come under such close scrutiny. In a lot if cases – especially when it comes to packaging – paper and board are the only alternative options to plastic, therefore opening up a world of replacement possibilities for the industry. There is also huge potential to gain from creating new products derived from side streams at pulp mills to replace other products currently made from fossil fuels. But is the industry ready to take on all these challenges? It became abundantly clear from our discussions in Brussels that people working in this industry at all levels are totally aware that there is a lot of work to be done, and a long way to go before opportunities are maximized. What our panelists also all agreed on was the fact that the pulp and paper industries need to develop a more entrepreneurial approach to tackling these opportunities before other, outside industries do. All panelists agreed that these are exciting times, and that now is the time to attract the very best in young talent and smart minds to ensure the future health of both the pulp and paper industries.

To support such innovation and progress towards circularity, in 2021 Huhtamaki partnered with RiverRecycle, theFinnish cleantech start-up, and VTT Technical Research Centre to develop a prototype waste collector which was built and tested in Finland, to tackle floating river waste. Today, RiverRecycle, has reached a significant milestone by collecting over a million kg of waste from four rivers around the world. Huhtamaki was closely involved in the project in Mumbai resulting in the waste collector being put into operation on the Mithi river. In addition to building, and setting up the river-cleaner, Huhtamaki also facilitated local hands-on workshops on effective waste management and recycling with a view to driving systemic change. According to the UN Environment Program (UNEP), 19–23 million tonnes of plastic waste ends up in seas, rivers and other water bodies every year.Thomasine Kamerling, Executive Vice President of Sustainability and Communications at Huhtamaki, congratulates RiverRecycle on their achievement: RiverRecycle collaborates with local businesses and communities to generate value from waste without burdening the municipality's limited budgets. Their system is customized to meet the specific needs of the communities to their benefit. Anssi Mikola, CEO of RiverRecycle, stated: \"RiverRecycle isn't just about collecting waste; it's about reshaping the way we see and handle plastic waste in our environment. We are demonstrating that our approach, which emphasizes collaboration and sustainability, thrives. We are proving that environmental responsibility and sustainable business can go hand in hand. Huhtamaki has been one of our first partner, and we would not have reached this milestone without their support. \" Huhtamaki's ambition is to have 100% of its products designed to be recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2030. In India, our main manufacturing focus lies on producing high-quality flexible packaging that provides protection for products such as food, pharmaceuticals, personal care, and home care items. We have already introduced multiple recyclable mono-material structures as part of our blueloop™ brand. Additionally, under India's G20 presidency, Huhtamaki is one of the 39 companies globally to join the Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy Industry Coalition (RECEIC), launched by the central government in India.",

This was then transported to and assembled in Mumbai, where it is now operational and where it will be collecting waste from the Mithi River for the next 12 months. \"We believe in protecting food, people and the planet. We also believe that cooperation across the value chain with key stakeholders is needed to address global sustainability challenges, for example such as in this case marine plastics. If we want to drive systemic change, we not only need to support the development and commercialization of innovation that can help stop waste from getting into the oceans, but we also need the monetization of waste and incentivization of local communities to improve their waste management practices,\" says Thomasine Kamerling, Executive Vice President Sustainability and Communications at Huhtamaki. \"When operating in a circular economy, cooperation among different players is fundamental to sustainability. Huhtamaki funding enabled us to complete two of the three parts of our journey of transforming plastic waste into a resource, with the positive engagement of affected communities. Huhtamaki's commitment is an example of how collaboration helps solve global problems such as plastic waste pollution,\" says Anssi Mikola, CEO and Founder of RiverRecycle. The Mithi River project is run by a global partnership between UNTIL (now known as UN Global Pulse), VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, RiverRecycle and Earth5R, an India-based citizen-led environmental movement. In addition to building, setting up and operating the river cleaner for a year, Huhtamaki's donation has been used to organize local hands-on workshops on effective waste management and recycling with a view to drive systemic change. The project also provides input to VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland on the floating waste and its seasonal variations that can be used to optimize clean-up operations and recycling processes for the future. \"The Huhtamaki funding enables the adaption of optical sensors and drones in the detection of floating plastic objects and differentiation of plastics from organic material. VTT's contribution also includes pyrolysis test runs and assessing chemical recycling of the recovered plastic waste fractions. At a broader level we aim to enhance circular economy solutions for the global challenge of plastic waste pollution. In addition to the technology involvement, we also appreciate the collaboration between local partners and communities as an essential part of the successful project implementation,\" says Jukka Sassi, Senior Scientist, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. Huhtamaki's ambition is to have 100% of its products designed to be recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2030. In India, where Huhtamaki has 16 units and manufactures mainly high-quality flexible packaging that protect for example food, pharmaceuticals and personal and home care products, the Company has already several recyclable flexible packaging structures in the market under its Huhtamaki blueloop concept. In addition to the Mithi River project, Huhtamaki is contributing to the building of necessary recycling infrastructure by setting up a pilot recycling plant for flexible packaging in India which should be operational by the end of 2021. ''We are excited to be a part of this global partnership and the development of the technology enabling us to clean Mithi, the only river that flows through the heart of Mumbai. This project promotes sustainability with a holistic approach by collecting plastic waste, while also empowering local communities to gain knowledge and employment,'' notes Sudip Mall, Managing Director, Flexible Packaging India at Huhtamaki. The Mithi River project is one of three initiatives that Huhtamaki funded as part of its 100-year anniversary to address global sustainability challenges and build and learn from circular economy initiatives globally.
